# Series Convergence

In $\sum_{k=0}^\infty a(r^k)$, where $|r|<1$, the series converges to $\sum_{k=0}^\infty a(r^k) = \frac{a}{1-r}$ 

In $\sum_{k=0}^n a(r^k)$,  $\sum_{k=0}^n a(r^k) = \frac{a-ar^{n+1}}{1-r}$ 

If the intergral to infinity is convergent, the sequence is convergent as long as the sequence is continuous, positive, and decreasing. The inverse applies, too.

## Power Series
$\sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \frac{1}{n^p}$

If a p-series has a p > 1, the p-series will converge

If a p-series has a p <= 1, the p-series will diverge

A lso, if $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} = C\ (0<c<\infty)$, the two series will either both converge or both diverge. So you only need to test one.

Provided that $a_n,b_n \geq 0\ \&\ a_n \leq b_n$
