# Crisis of Liberal Democracy
- When unifying crisises occur 
- When police and millitary becomes over-controlling
- When an individual seizes power by force without remediation from constitution
- When a party becomes uniformly controlling of the government without competition
- When central tenants of demcracy were extrinsically distrubed
- When promises go unchecked or undelivered
- When popular support becomes undefeated 


Liquitity crisis: elements of mobile society becomes fix/stuck

## Agricultural Crisis
- Agriculture requires the ability to take debt: that you need money to plant, and you get return in the end
- During a system of overproduction, governments has to "pay people not to work." Meaning, governments like the US had to buy up supply and start burning them.
- Western nations, during the agricultural crisis
	- Protectionism
	- Tightening credit/payback
	- Diversion of bubles => anarchic response in global markets: every country trying to protect themselves and hence hurting the collective
	
## Amercian Financing
- US funds attempted to force German industrial expansion and recovery
- Governments, using this fund, tries to legitamate themselves by stimulating inflation and creating fancy things

"The New Deal Programs" => some say that there is a hinderance to the economy

Instead of having money go into the economy, US credit system caused "speculative bubbles": bubbles that are caused by traders speculating individuals' will to buy something. i.e. Florida real estate + stock markets.

Margin trading began: a lot of investors are making a bubble through margins. 

John Keens proposes that captalism is not self-regulating because of the humanistic, animalistic emotions within the marget.
