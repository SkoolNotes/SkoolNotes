# Crisis of Liberal Democracy
- When unifying crisises occur 
- When police and millitary becomes over-controlling
- When an individual seizes power by force without remediation from constitution
- When a party becomes uniformly controlling of the government without competition
- When central tenants of demcracy were extrinsically distrubed
- When promises go unchecked or undelivered
- When popular support becomes undefeated
