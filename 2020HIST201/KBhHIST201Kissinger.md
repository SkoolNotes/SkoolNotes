# Diplomacy, Kissinger

The Document: [[KBe20hist201srcKissingerAnnotated]]

CLAIM: European balance of power system emerged after medieval collapse

## European Power Balance
**Development into model of "universality" => one emperor, one church**

### The Holy Roman Empire
[[KBhHIST201HolyRomanEmpire1500s]]

### System of Raison De 'Etat
As a mean to fend off an every-growing HRE threatening France, Cardinal Richaleu came up with a system named [[KBhHIST201RaisonDeEtat]] that promises to be a better system of government.

## England, the Mediator

[[KBhHIST201EnglandMediator]]

## Kissinger's Take Home Messages

And I quote:

"""

* Power is difficult to access
* Equilibrium best achieved if they are in common interest
* Balance of power inhibits capacity to overthrow order
* Agreement on shared values inhibits desire to overthrow order
* Power without legitamacy tempts dangerous strength tests
* Legitimacy without power tempts empty power tests

"""

**Kissinger sees himself as American Richlieu.**

End result of Raison d'etat

1. Others form a coalition against the ruthless nation => balance of power is eventually achieved
2. Unipolar dominance of a world system/world hegemony => too dominant to fight back against


***

McNeill

* Consolidation for political power (310-311)
1. Administrative centralization: italian city-state strategies to govern countries
2. Seizing Church power and property during the Reformation: Catholics trade away political power to re-affirm their religious
3. Development of military technology becomes too expensive to do rurally to larger factories in a city: standing army cannot be tracked in a local level

The renessance brings two things: either harness renissance energy to do innovation or harness reformation energy to unify Europe â€” if someone has the ability to have warfare.
