# Diplomacy, Kissinger

The Document: [[KBe20hist201srcKissingerAnnotated]]

CLAIM: European balance of power system emerged after medieval collapse

## European Power Balance
**Development into model of "universality" => one emperor, one church**

### The Holy Roman Empire
[[KBhHIST201HolyRomanEmpire1500s]]

### System of Raison De 'Etat
As a mean to fend off an every-growing HRE threatening France, Cardinal Richaleu came up with a system named [[KBhHIST201RaisonDeEtat]] that promises to be a better system of government.




* Conquest made Prussia a "_bona-fide_ Great Power"
* Prussia joined by France, Spain, etc. in war of 1740-1748
* In 1756-1763, switched sides
* CLAIM: pure result of calculations of benefit
* Nonsecular wars less violent than holy wars because CLAIM: they did not involve emotion
* England mediated
* Policy based on throwing itself into the weaker side
* King William III engineered this
* _Raison d'etat_ did not require expansion, for "national interest to be in the preservation of the European balance"
* Glorious revolution kicked James II off the throne, chose William of Orange of the Netherlands as replacement
* Used the fact that if France occupied Belgium, it would surely eat up the Netherlands, to cause England to fight in the war
* So, William fought Louis XIV
* Formed Grand Alliance — Sweden Spain Savoy, Austria, Netherlands, and England all against France
* Constantly fought, and left France to be strong but not dominant
* Textbook Balance of Power!
* The fighting as a classic example if _Raison d'etat_: ideologically, England and France are on the same side. However, it is not in England's best interest to join them

**CLAIM**: 

> In this manner, Great Britain became the balancer of the European equilibrium, first almost by default, later by conscious strategy. Without Great Britain 's tenacious commitment to that role, France would almost surely have achieved hegemony over Europe in the eighteenth or nine- teenth century, and Germany would have done the same in the modern period.

**Kissinger's Take Home Messages** 

And I quote:

"""

* Power is difficult to access
* Equilibrium best achieved if they are in common interest
* Balance of power inhibits capacity to overthrow order
* Agreement on shared values inhibits desire to overthrow order
* Power without legitamacy tempts dangerous strength tests
* Legitimacy without power tempts empty power tests

"""

**Kissinger sees himself as American Richlieu.**

End result of Raison d'etat

1. Others form a coalition against the ruthless nation => balance of power is eventually achieved
2. Unipolar dominance of a world system/world hegemony => too dominant to fight back against

McNeill

* Consolidation for political power (310-311)
1. Administrative centralization: italian city-state strategies to govern countries
2. Seizing Church power and property during the Reformation: Catholics trade away political power to re-affirm their religious
3. Development of military technology becomes too expensive to do rurally to larger factories in a city: standing army cannot be tracked in a local level

The renessance brings two things: either harness renissance energy to do innovation or harness reformation energy to unify Europe — if someone has the ability to have warfare.
