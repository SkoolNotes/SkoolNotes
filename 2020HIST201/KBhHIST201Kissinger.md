#disorganized #flo

* European balance of power system emerged after medieval collapse
* Development into model of "universality" => one emperor, one church
* If the Holy Roman Emperor were to actually succeed, all of Europe would become auxillaries to it 
    * So, why no central control?
        1. Lack of transportation and communication systems made tying largue countries together difficult
        2. HRE had separation between church and state, which makes the authority less authoritative
    * Pope + emperor constantly fought 
        * Need constitution to settle
        * Enabled feutal rulers to enhance autonomy 
        * Hasburg dynasty + combination with Spanish royalty => Über powerful HRE => Almost centralized nation
        * CLAIM: eventually weakened pope brought end to religious universality, which brought end to that centralized Europe idea
    * Raison d'etat
        * _Each state depended on the other. The well being of the state justified whatever means were employed to further it. The national interest supplanted the medival notion of a universal morality._
            * Balance of power became dominant
            * INFERENCE: more sensible government
    * France!
        * CLAIM: lost the most by the boom of the Holy Roman Empire
            * Near-death of HRE would allow France to expand eastwards
            * Cardinal de Richelieu
                * "Father of the modern state system"
                * Proposed and practiced Raison d'etat for France
        * Counter-reformation
            * HRE trying to revive Catholic universality + stamp out protenstaism
            * Lead to Thirty Years' War => 1618
                * Danish and Swedish armies cut into Germany
                * French army joined in too
                * Devistated central Europe + lost Germany a theird of its population
            * And then… our good friend Richelieu instituted Raison d'etat
                * France was surrounded by HRE
                * All others loyal to HRE  
                * Hence, the Cardinal disregarded the fact that he is the Cardinal, and instituted this idea => State > Religion
                * Sided with the Protestants 
                
                CLAIM: 
                
              > Had the Habsburg emperors played according to the same rules or understood the emerging world of _raison d'etat,_ they would have seen how well placed they were to achieve what Richelieu feared most-the pre-eminence of Austria and the emergence of the Holy Roman Empire as the dominant power on the Continent 
              
      * HRE Emperor Ferdinand II
          * Practiced the opposite of *raison d'etat*, which means religion + morality > state interest
          * Refused to treaty with the Muslim Turks/Protestant Swedes
          * Less concerned with the Empire's welfare than that of the will of god
          *
