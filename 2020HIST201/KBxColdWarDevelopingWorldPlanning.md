Powers Edge: Ideological Manipulation in Foreign Countries





instating leaders in foreign coutries -> dictators that we cant do anything about
dictators because fighting against the wants of the people



## Note-taking, begin!

- America overthrew Sukarno in 1965, and replaced him with the right wing Suharto who was big bad news

- evidence that america was involed? 

- america had already participated in a revolt against sukar in 1958
- america congragulated suharto and themselves when he smashed the commies

- this guy argues that america didnt play a large role

- america prodded the army to take down sukaro but it didnt work
	- they had "bassically given up"
- Amercia gave up, the coup caught the CIA by surprise

- lyndon b johson and w post watergate means we get info

- cia was on a short leash, if they had plans to move against, then washintion would know 
	- he didnt, and thus, CIA was not involved.
	- cia admitted that they didnt have a connection
