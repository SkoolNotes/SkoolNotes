# The Ottomans' Fall
* "Natural consequences of earlier Turkish successes"
* Got Romanitus â€” expanded too much to the point of unmanagability => "Strategical Overextension"
* Switched to an "Iron Fist" management style of crushing dissidents, encouraging the Persians to ally with the Europeans to crush the Ottomans
* Suffered from being centralized, despotic, and severly orthodox
    * Emperor had to much power
    * Country became over-conservative
    * Bureaucracy became too heavy
    * Heavy internal plundering
        * High taxes
        * Seizures of property 
        * Depopulated towns
        * Unorderly soldiers
        * Bribery
