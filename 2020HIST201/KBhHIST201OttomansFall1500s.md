# The Ottomans' Fall
## Problems with Silver  [[KBhHIST201ProblemsWithSilver]]

@[[KBhHIST201BullietCh19]] Bulliet Chapter 19

* Affected landowners
* Could not build stronger millitary
* Caused the weakening of calvalrymen + increase in reliance on POWs

## Overconservatism 
@[[KBhHIST201KennedyCh1]] Kenedy, Chapter 1

> "Natural consequences of earlier Turkish successes"

* Got Romanitus — expanded too much to the point of unmanagability => "Strategical Overextension"
* Switched to an "Iron Fist" management style of crushing dissidents, encouraging the Persians to ally with the Europeans to crush the Ottomans
* Suffered from being centralized, despotic, and severly orthodox
    * Emperor had to much power
    * Country became over-conservative #why
    * Bureaucracy became too heavy
* Heavy internal plundering
    * High taxes
    * Seizures of property 
    * Depopulated towns
    * Unorderly soldiers
    * Bribery
    
@[[KBhHIST201BullietCh19]] Bulliet Chapter 19

> "Religious laws … constrained the ottomans from reforming the tax system"

* Levied surtaxes
* Caused rebellions + banditry
* POWS took advantage of influence to gain the ability to marry and do business, but overall caused deterioation of the qualitiy of the millitary (less professionals, more POWs)

## Declining government

@[[KBhHIST201BullietCh19]]

### Sultans kept to themselves
* Prevented male relatives from leaving the palace
* _Females gained larger rule_ + chief administrators oversaw the actual government **important!**:  CLAIM — sterotipically, muslim culture had fears of woman in politics

### Dismantling original systems
* Land grants for millitary services disappeared
* Abolished devshirme system which selected POW officers
* Tax farming became allowed
    * Tax collectors are allowed to pre-paid tax and collect any amount to recouperate
    * Caused local administration to suffer due to the above
* Corruption within the government lead them to give power to tax collectors
    * Causing them to control the incomes and expenses of a regions
    * Which turns them into large private landowners
    
### The armies kept deteriorating
* Resorted to hiring substitutes
* Also relied partially on trained seasonal recruits 

### European trade capitulations
* Europeans took control of Ottomans' overseas trade "Capitulations" — special trade agreements
    * European domination of Ottoman seaborne trade
    * Muslim merchants are trading at a disadvantage due to this domination
* Few Ottoman statesmen observed the change, but they are generally disregarded
* "Tulip Craze" => European integration
    * Early sign of destruction shown with the Ottomans' craze on Tulips
    * European cultures integrated into the Ottoman culture — clothing, books, furtinutes
    * At _gala soirees_, Janissaries revolted, causing the abdication of Sultan Ahmed III
* Eventually, Janissary commanders became independent rulers, causing a slip of control  

* Rural disorder also caused new economic opportunities
    * CLAIM: ottoman's lack of control brings other European costal regions to resume originally Ottoman controlled trades
    * Local farmers shifted growth to cash crops (tobacco, cotton, oil, etc.)
