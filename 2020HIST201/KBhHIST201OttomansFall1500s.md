# The Ottomans' Fall

## Problems with Silver  [[KBhHIST201ProblemsWithSilver]]

@[[KBhHIST201BullietCh19]] Bulliet Chapter 19

* Affected landowners
* Could not build stronger millitary
* Caused the weakening of calvalrymen + increase in reliance on POWs

## Overconservatism 
@[[KBhHIST201KennedyCh1]] Kenedy, Chapter 1

> "Natural consequences of earlier Turkish successes"

* Got Romanitus — expanded too much to the point of unmanagability => "Strategical Overextension"
* Switched to an "Iron Fist" management style of crushing dissidents, encouraging the Persians to ally with the Europeans to crush the Ottomans
* Suffered from being centralized, despotic, and severly orthodox
    * Emperor had to much power
    * Country became over-conservative #why
    * Bureaucracy became too heavy
* Heavy internal plundering
    * High taxes
    * Seizures of property 
    * Depopulated towns
    * Unorderly soldiers
    * Bribery

"Religious laws … constrained the ottomans from reforming the tax system"
        * Levied surtaxes
        * Caused rebellions + banditry
    * POWS took advantage of influence to gain the ability to marry and do business, but overall caused deterioation of the qualitiy of the millitary (less professionals, more POWs)
