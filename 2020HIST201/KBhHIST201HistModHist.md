#  Models of History
## Watson

Watson's Model: scale from... 

| Independence                     | ..                               | ..                                              | Full Order            |
|:--------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------:|:---------------------:|
| Indipendence States (no control) | Hegemony (some external control) | Dominion (some external, some internal control) | Empire (full control) |

See [[KBhHIST201Watson]] Watson's Model of States

## Arrigi
* When people talk about Hegemony, they often mean dominance

> In order to achieve hegemony/dominion in a system, a state must transform how a history operates

***

A spectrum of governance with two extremes…

### "Territorialist Model"
* Success measured with territory + control
* Wealth and economy as byproduct

### "Capitalist Model"
* Success measured with the control over resources and trade
* Territorial acquisition as byproduct\

***

Arrigi claims that there are two main modes of power: the Capitalist — controlling trade and resources — and the territorialist — controlling land and people.

To reach **world hegemony** (become the world leader) — change the world order. For instance, Tang China turned the world from no model to a Territorialist model; US turned the world from a Territorialist model to a Capitalist model.

### Coercion vs Consent
* Means of power acquisition
* Either…
    * Coercion — force joining of a system via force (trade war, actual war)
    * Consent — use deals and negotiations to ask to join system
    
## Social Contract Theory
> The state arises from the cumulative experience of a populations' self-government as it grows and requires more and more attention

## Predatory THeory

    "War makes states, and states make war" — Charles Tilly
    
### Functions of a State

1. **War Making**: The act of eliminating rivals or potential external threats outside of its own territories.
2. **State Making**: The act of eliminating internal rival forces and insurgents from within its own territories.
3. **Protection**: The act of eliminating potential threats to its population.
4. **Extraction**: The act of securing the means to execute the previous three activities, such as the collection of taxes or revenue.
