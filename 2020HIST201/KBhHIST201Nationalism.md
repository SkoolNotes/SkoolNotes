# Nationalism

## Popular nationalism
"defining a nation from people up"

* Asserting political liberalism
* Creating power from politics

## Civic nationalism
"defining a nation from government down"

* Achieving civic nationalism
	* army
	* media
	* propaganda
	* unified education
	* infrastructure
	* start a war + create a "other"
	* Civil service groups
* Could be a benefit and a threat

**Popular nationalism failed, but civic nationalism (top-down control) was a success in both Germany and Italy** => Unification had both internal and external support

## Failures of Nationalism
Nationalism does not always work! Poland tried nationalizing with little success, with Poland actually being founded _after_ WWI

In other places in Europe, similar strategies had mixed success. Nationalism is successful for Greeks, Romanians, Norwegians Belgians, but failed for Irish and Czechs. It worked a bit for the Marxists in Russia, but that took longer.

Furthermore, the united nature of big nationalism countries like [[KBhHIST201GermanicNationalism]] brought bad results, like, uhh, the Nazis.
