# Europe's Western Takeover
## The Takeover
* Expanded towards Mexico, Peru, and Cuba — generally weaker nations to whom having artilirary is like gods #why #really?
* Capitalized upon the lands with absolute control, and discovered silver from the Potosí mines… Bringing rapid growth and [[KBhHIST201ProblemsWithSilver]] Problems with Silver
* Unlike [[KBhHIST201ZhengHeSeafaring]] Zheng He + Africa, Europeans came to the Americas and _stayed there_ with a government and army and all
* Colonies are less influenced by internal wars then are actual countries themselves

## The Impact
* Switch to emphasis on trade of staples instead of valuables 
* Many American crops (Maize, Indigo) and American-Grown crops (tobacco, rice, sugar) helped spark the economy and increase overall value
- Growth in employment and growth for large trade city (London, Bristol, Antwerp, Amsterdam)
- Expansion into Russian regions also added additional value
- Increased rivalry between European states brought increased competition and development
    - Added technology
    - Novel skills and industries
    - Increased emphasis on reasoning + science
- After a while, it became generally difficult for old-world powers to expand and regain control 

> The lack of economic and political rigidity would imply a similar lack of cultural and ideological orthodoxy—that is, a freedom to in quire, to dispute, to experiment, a belief in the possibilities of improvement, a concern for the practical rather than the abstract,
