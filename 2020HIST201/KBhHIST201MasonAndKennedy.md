# Mason and Kennedy

## Modern Europe Political Philosophies 
See [[KBhHIST201LiberalismAndNationalism]]

1848 German Confederation of States created based on novel nationalistic ideals anchored around German speaking countries.

## The Industrial Revolution
See [[KBhHIST201IndustrialRevolution]]

## Germanic States + Struggles of Nationalism 
**The 1860s created two important new states in Europe => using warfare and civic nationalism to create new connections**

See [[KBhHIST201GermanicNationalism]]

### Austria-Hungary
After international weakenings of Austria as shown by [[KBhHIST201GermanicNationalism]], the _Ausgleich_ (compromise) was signed creating a dual-monarchy of Austria and Hungary: each got own constitution + parliament, but joined together under the Hasburg crown.

### Creation of Nation-States
**Nation-States** (nationalized political identities) emerged in the sixteenth century => a very slow process

See [[KBhHIST201NationStates]]

### The Isms
**Seperatism**

CLAIM: when nationalism arises in multinational empires, national groups attempt to break away from the larger empire => engendering **separatism**. And it is indeed nationalism that caused the Ottoman Empire to break up

**Socialism**

 Lower-classes harboured socialism => a bottom-up approach of nationalism where resources are divided evenly.
 
**Irrendentism** 
  
 Middle and upper class created process that promotes the taking of land belonging to another state => fostered the creation of states like Germany and Italy
