* Post-Napoleonic International System was "strange"
* Created integration with a global economy
	* CLAIM: Erosion of tariff barrier + widespread free trade ideals => new international order
	* Struggle between 1793-1815 ("Great War") caused a yearning for stability
* This yearning encouraged longer-term commercial relations and investment
	* Wars, however, did not end
		* Europe's technical superiority increased the conflict for the less developed
		* CLAIM: military power accompanied the economic globalization
		* Regional/individual conflicts {territory, nationality, etc.} persisted
	* CLAIM: however, this did manage to limit the scope of conflicts
* Industrial revolution tech make impact on warfare
	* CLAIM Industrial/technical change affected war outcome more than finances
	* Financial sector began to expand
		* National + international banking increased
		* Regimes could raise funds much easier
	* War's emphasis was placed on wining fast instead of long-term mobilization + revenue => CLAIM rending finances less important
* Thesis CLAIM: international economy growth, Industrial Revolution, European stability, and military modernization => favored Great Powers
	*  Britain ticked so much boxes that worked out to become one that stands out form the rest
	*  CLAIM post-1860 industrialization will change world balance again
* Data helps us determine the degree of change that actually occurs
	* However, this is a flawed system for smaller democracies => economic wealth did not translate into military power
	* Statistics are usually calculated afterwards, anyways
* The Industrial Revolution
	* A very _slow_ process
	* Started affecting only a certain amount of manufacturers + is a slow-moving process
	* Definition: "the substitution of inanimate for animated sources of power through the conversion of heat into work."
		* CLAIM: primary benefit Allowed mankind to explore new sources of energy
			* For instance, twenty-folded the production of driven looms
			* Had cascading effect: better access to technology turned textile industry to be more productive which created a demand to more machines, cotton, iron, and communication
		* Also other systemic benefits, however
			* Created the wage-labor factory work system => massive increase in productivity
	* Sent the world population to go up very high but was able to sustain itself because the product of technology and the technology acquired allowed population and sustinence to grow alongside each other â€” keeping both in check, so boo Malthus
			* Economic size, productivity, and purchasing power increased far more than the actual population
			* "In Queen Victoria's reign alone, product per capita rose two and a half times."
	* Living conditions, however, is terrible => The "proletariat" as a social class began existing => lived in "unhealthy, crowed, jerry-built cities"
	* But, CLAIM, this was overall a good thing b/c in dramatically increased production with little to the actual cost
* How the industrial revolution screwed over China
	* CLAIM: two sufferings, "relative and absolute".
	* Asian countries lost their share of world manufacturing
	* The "impact of the Western man"
		* Created novel economic relationships benefiting the west
			* Coastal traders
			* Shippers
			* Consuls
		* Shipped diseases around the world
		* Created worldwide infrastructure
			* Roads
			* Railway
			* Telegraph
			* Harbors
			* Civic buildings
		* But also plundered and killed during conquering 
	* Created an advancement in military technology
		* Increased the rate of fire
		* Invention of light field artillery
		* Prevented the indigenous people from fighting back using the old technology
		* European seapower could extend inland, and eventually lead to the Opium War
		* Some in the middle east was able to adopt the European fighting technique, but China, for instance, could not
		* The "gunpower gap" created that nations would have hundreds of times the capacity to fight comapred to they did before

* The 1860s created two important new states in Europe => using warfare and civic nationalism to create new connections
* CLAIM: Conservative establishments of Europe was threatened by 1840s nationalism
	* Strong figures in Germany and Italy created national states from a top-down approach using modern tech warfare
	* Post-German Unification wars, Germany became the largest+strongest state in Europe
* Nation-State emerged in the sixteenth century => a very slow process
	* Strong monarchs began creating stronger national states w/ breaking local lord power + consolidating governmental power
	* Idea of a "nation" is actually a new thing => "group of people with a common culture, sense of identity, and political aspirations" (no longer monarch-soverignty based)
	* National identity fostered by the culture (artists, writers, linguists)    
		* Lit woks helped defined national groups + foster sense of identity
		* Musicians also contributed by adding elements local music into their composition
		* Dictionaries were compiled to the understanding of the local culture
	* Ethnic groups began acquiring a _common heritage_ => shapes identity => strengthens the heritage => Boom Nationalism
	* CLAIM: when nationalism arises in multinational empires, national groups attempt to break away from the larger empire => engendering **separatism**
		* CLAIM: it is indeed nationalism that caused the Ottoman Empire to break up
	* Lower-classes harboured socialism => a bottom-up approach of nationalism, but the middle and upper class created irredentism (taking land belonging to another state) => fostered the creation of states like Germany and Italy 
* Unification of Germany
	* Otto von Bismarck lead Prusisa to wage war on neighboring states to consolidate German territories
	* Bismarck wanted to strengthen the position of Prussia => made the "Iron and Blood" speech that called for absolute top-down unity of Germany
	* Advocated for the creation of a German confederation but w/o Austria => achieved by small, short wars against decisive land
	* Wanted to remove Austria from the German region so that Prussia would be the only one that shapes German business
		* Fought the "Seven Weeks' War" => very, very, very quick
		* CLAIM: won because of INDUSTIRALIZAION! and the new military technologies of logistics and better guns 
	* After weakening Austria, the North German Confederation was formed w/ a new parliament and broad suffrage
* Austria-Hungary
	* After international weakenings of Austria, the _Ausgleich_ (compromise) was signed
	* Created dual-monarchy of Austria and Hungary: each got own constitution + parliament, but joined together under the Hasburg crown
	* However, this did not help other nationalities such as that of the Slavic people => which was CLAIM a cause of WWI
* Top-down nationalism, top-down view
	* Popular nationalism failed, but civic nationalism (top-down control) was a success in both Germany and Italy
	* Unification had both internal and outside support	
	* Was not a useful in other places in Europe
		* Poland tried nationalizing with little success, with Poland actually being founded _after_ WWI
		* Mixed success
			* Successful for Greeks, Romanians, Norwegians Belgians
			* Failed for the Irish and Czechs
		* The Russians took even longer
		* CLAIM: this need-but-can't nationalize situation ignited WWI
* Creation of Germany became an acceleration of the Industrial Revolution
* Bismarck created a united Germany, and set the backdrop of the freaking Nazis
