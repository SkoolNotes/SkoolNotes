# Realism:
_A Raison de etat inspired international relations theory_

- Community of states exists in **anarchy**: no worldwide "911" event, and there's no universal world policy
- Thus, international politics is a **self-help** system; allies could help but security is not guaranteed
  - allies are like the friend in the locker room: they may help you beat someone up, but they aren't gaurenteed to be there

- **Power** is the key to maintain security
  - you never know how much power you need to stay safe
- **Security** is an act of re-balance: one state's security hurt the security of other states

**Longer term factors are nearly invisible.**

Causality exists between long term and short term events => Short term changes are caused therefore by longer term change while long term events are hyped up by shorter events
