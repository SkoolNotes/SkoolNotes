# Raison d'etat
 > Each state depended on the other. The well being of the state justified whatever means were employed to further it. The national interest supplanted the medieval notion of a universal morality. --- KBhHIST201Kissinger
	
A method of "sensible government" that promises to set aside personal ideological differences for the betterment of the country as a whole.	

## Exhibit A: France!

[[KBhHIST201FrenchRichelieuAndRaisonDeEtat]]

## Failure and Overextension

CLAIM @[[KBhHIST201Kissinger]] â€” too much power without morality is no good, for instance

### Exhibit B: Still France!

* **Louis XIV**, under the guidance of [[KBhHIST201FrenchRichelieuAndRaisonDeEtat]], gone trigger happy on the expansion
* Ultimately, this is detrimental
	* When most states starts being fully rational and not at all moral, this becomes less fun 
	* If no one else is expanding, a country will keep taking advantage of others, which... does not make you a lot of friends
	
> Under Raison d'etat, "The stronger would seek to dominate, and the weaker would resist by forming coalitions to augment their individual strengths"
