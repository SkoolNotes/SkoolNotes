# mechanisms of planned obscelescence

## contrived durability (key parts made out of eg. plastic)

## percieved obselescence: colors + shape changes

## systemic obselescence: ports / standards being changed

## programmed obselescence: dropping support for old versions

## bloatware obselescence: requiring vastly more hardware to make old devices slow

## legal obselescence: eg. emissions limits on cars

## repair prevention seals + screws

## repair preventaion construction (hard to access batteries)

## percieved obselescence

### \"embrace the notch\"

### repeated changes to bezels

### repeated changes to camera configuration

### repeated changes to colors

## programmed obselescence

### dropping support

### bloatware

## repair prevention

### seals (glue)

### [Tri-point screw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#/media/File:Screw_Head_-_Tri-point.svg) + [pentalobe screw](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pentalobular.svg)

### battery replacement/integration

### glued and hard-to-access connectors

# arguments for these types of obselescence

## its okay if battery fades, bc tech develops so quickly

## constant purchasing allows tech to develop faster
