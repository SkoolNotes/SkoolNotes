# The Holy Roman Empire

Attempted to adopt the model of European universality => one church, one emperor.

But... They didn't! Because...

## Reasons for non-universality

@[[KBhHIST201Kissinger]]

1. Lack of transportation and communication systems made tying large countries together difficult
2. HRE had separation between church and state, which makes the authority less authoritative
3. Pope + emperor constantly fought 
	* Need constitution to settle
	* Enabled fuetal rulers to enhance autonomy 
	* Hasburg dynasty + combination with Spanish royalty => Ãœber powerful HRE => Almost centralized nation
	* Yet, eventually weakened pope brought end to religious universality, which brought end to that centralized Europe idea
