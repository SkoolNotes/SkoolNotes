# The Holy Roman Empire

Attempted to adopt the model of European universality => one church, one emperor.

But... They didn't! Because...

## Reasons for non-universality

@[[KBhHIST201Kissinger]]

1. Lack of transportation and communication systems made tying large countries together difficult
2. HRE had separation between church and state, which makes the authority less authoritative
3. Pope + emperor constantly fought 
	* Need constitution to settle
	* Enabled fuetal rulers to enhance autonomy 
	* Hasburg dynasty + combination with Spanish royalty => Ãœber powerful HRE => Almost centralized nation
	* Yet, eventually weakened pope brought end to religious universality, which brought end to that centralized Europe idea
	
Meanwhile, in France... [[KBhHIST201RaisonDeEtat]]	

## Counter-Reformation
A process of "revving Catholic universality".

See [[KBhHIST201CounterReformation]]

## Emperor Ferdinand II
 Practiced the... well... opposite of [[KBhHIST201RaisonDeEtat]] => Religion + Morality > state interest
 
*  Refused to treaty with Muslim Turks + Protestant Swedes
*  "Less concerned with the Empire's welfare than that of the will of God ... The state existed to serve the religion ... for Ferdinand" -- [[KBhHIST201Kissinger]]
* **Edict of reinstatution* => Demanded land taken by protestants since 1555 be returned
