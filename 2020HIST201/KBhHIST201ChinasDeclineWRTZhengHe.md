# China's Decline: Zheng He

After 1433, an edict suddenly called off [[KBhHIST201ZhengHeSeafaring]] the missions of Zheng He. The ending of these mission, according to [[KBhHIST201KennedyCh1]] and [[KBhHIST201MannMing]], is the warning sign for the decline of the economy in general.

Researchers speculate different causes of endingâ€¦ 

## Models for Reasons for Zheng He's Missions Ending
### Camp China-Was-Lazy and Conservative
[[KBhHIST201MannMing]]

* cultural superiority
* self-engrossment
* CONFUCIANISM! #sic @[[KBhHIST201KennedyCh1]]
    * China is a conservative, Confucian country
        * Merchants are disliked
        * So are private capital
        * Armies are too!
        * A side note about tech
            * Confucianism actually does encourage tech
            * Simply requires building for knowledge or state purposes, and not for armies/private property
    * China attempted to emulate their "old ways", especially after the mongol clearing => caused closing
    
### Camp China-Coulden't-Care-Less
[[KBhHIST201MannMing]]

* Abundant resources already in China
* Nothing that the expedition saw actually actively "wow"ed China
* Assets needed could be found easily through good-ol-fashioned trade
* Seafaring was costly, and did not help the Northern Mongol invasions (duh)

Mann kind of agree with these people, but he mostly thinks that [[KBhHIST201ChinasDeclineWRTCurrency]] China's Decline w.r.t. Currency is the main issue.

Sidenote: "party A says, party B says, I say" is a very common order.

## China never had a free market??
* Along with Zheng He's mission, overseas trade was banned @fact
* However, it was reversed again (see the source [[KBhHIST201ChinasDecline1500]]), confusingly
