# Gelvin Chapter 5
* States fought over the emergent control after the crisis of the 17th century.
* Employed the strategy of **Defensive Developmentalism.**

Defensive developmentalism: develop your country as a defense against others

> "Developing because Europe is happening to you."

## Defensive Developmentalism
**Denfense developmentalism: centralizing authority by making goverment more efficient and managing resource better.**

1) Millitary reform to consolidate power.
2) Control and coordinate population and resource
3) Decipline population to become agents of State.

* Eliminated cash farming and augmented admin.
* DD encouraged the process of monopolization and direct contro

### Problems in DD
* Local suspicious caused difficulty in implementing centralized control
	 * implimentation of government plans is difficult due to the emergence of local resistance.
	* New class of the educated under the new system championed the improved inclusion in governance. Many framed this plea as the plea for constitutional governance
* the middle eastern implimentation of DD had focus on developing indurstry to support the DD processes such as the army => free trade is opposite DD, which caused paradoxical effects.
* Centralization helped very little people except for the central government, making it resisted very widely.


## Ottomans and DD
* Ottoman DD happened in two periods.
	*  Per. 1: tanzimat — the “liberal” period where constitutionalism was briefly trialed
	* Per. 2: promotion of direct control by the sultan.
	* Two phases’ change was a change from bottom-up nationalism to top-down nationalism.
* Process of DD impliementation
	* Ottomans first attempted economic control. That didn’t go really well either — lack of monies and control.
		* After doing everything wrong, the Ottomans conceded to build an open economy and be connected
	* The widespread nature of the ottomans made it diffucult to have a central point of control.
	* Millitary reform was tried again, creating European-style New Corps. This was used to eliminate the janissaries.
	* System of equality actually promoted more discord between communites.
	* The efforts of bottom-up nationalisation was disliked by everyone except the hindus, b/c the Muslims felt that it hindered the dominance of the muslimes while the Christians wanted to avoid the widespread conscription
