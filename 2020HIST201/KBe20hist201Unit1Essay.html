            <p>#source bulliet - Ottoman military was originally made of cavalry and Janissaries - Cavalry were paid with land, while Janissaries were paid with money. Janissaries were also more effective under devshirme - to regain land, government squeezed out cavalry - Inflation from south american silver also caused fixed currency peoples to struggle - all this led to revolt (cavalry + suddenly poor people) - Janissaries took advantage to make “Janissication” hereditary and marry/start businesses - Revolts + Ended up costing more -&gt; government struggling</p>
