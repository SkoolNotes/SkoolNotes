# The west? Japan? 

- were highly civilized when 'they alloed the westerners to discorver them' 
- westernization of japan, 
	- > (ish) looked like it had been opened by westerners but it actully had exploded from within 
## background: two centuries of isolation: 1640—1854 

- japan was isolated, no one was alowwed to leave and foreneris were not allowed to enter 
- these policies were based on experience 
- shoguns and stuff 
- miltatary formed a dictatorship 
- class lies began to blur as people went into povrerty, then merchants and artisans started to prosper 
- many people stopped believing in buddhism 

## the opening. 

- nobles were heavily in debt 
	- couldnt produce from agriculture, 
	- so turned to foreing trade. 
- buncha stuff

## meji era 

- forced the shogun to resign
- turned it into a modern nation state
- abolished feudalism 
- people adopted shintoism 
- industrilization and financial modernization happened, led to increase in wealth and massive boom in population 


## russia and stuff 

- russian gov needed 
	- > atmosphere of crisis and expansion to stifle criticism of tsarism at home;
- war broke our in 1904 between japan and russia 
- buncha dates and stuff 
- > The Japanese victory set off long chains of repercussions in at least three different directions. First, the Russian government, frustrated in its foreign policy in East Asia, shifted its attention back to Europe, where it re sumed an active role in the affairs of the Balkans
- led to russian revolution
- > The moral was clear. Everywhere leaders of subjugated peoples concluded, from the Japanese precedent, that they must bring Western science and industry to their own countries, but that they must do it, as the Japa nese had done, by getting rid of control by the Europeans, supervising the process of modernization themselves, and preserving their own native na tional character. 

- sum of ending: 
	- > The Japanese victory and Russian defeat can therefore be seen as steps in three mighty developments: the First World War, the Russian Revolution, and the Revolt of Asia. These three together put an end to Europe’s world supremacy and to confident ideas about the in evitable progress and expansion of European civilization; or at least they so transmuted them as to make the world of the twentieth century far different from that of the nineteenth.
