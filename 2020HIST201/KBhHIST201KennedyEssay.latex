In Chapter 1 of \emph{Rise and Fall of the Great Powers}, Paul Kennedy
sketches out an explanation of why the Ming Dynasty was, on the one hand
powerful and prosperous, but ultimately was ``a country which had turned
in on itself'' and subject to ``steady relative decline.'' Mann, in his
chapter on the Ming trade, gives the reader a lot more detail on the
nuances of Ming history in this period. Putting Kennedy and Mann into
dialogue, does Kennedy's argument still hold up? In your essay, argue
for or against Kennedy's argument using the details of Ming history
analyzed by Mann.

  China actually tried this! @{[}{[}KBhHIST201MannMing{]}{]}

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    Coastal commissioner of Fu Jian threw in the towel after trying

Reopening

\begin{quote}
The government reversed course not only because it recognized its

much Fujian's populace depended on trade. Beijing had come to realize
that the nation desperately needed the merchants' most important good:
silver.

\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
In 1642, so much silver has been produced that its value is falling even
as the mines slacken.
\end{quote}

=\textgreater{} Which, caused a failing of the Chinese economy

\begin{quote}
Like the Spanish king, the Ming emperor backs his military ventures with
Spanish silver, which his subjects must use to pay their taxes. When the
value of silver falls, the government runs out of money.
\end{quote}

So, it doesn't really matter trade/no trade; pirates/no pirates ---
there exists a fundamental problem with the Chinese economy's basis on a
currency so easily influenced by the central government that's still
learning how a globalized economy works.

\textbf{Mongols are pretty darn bad, but ultimately only a scapegote for
a bigger problem}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Mongols never really left

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Strong milltary holds lead to extended fights
  \item
    Eventually, we ended up with the Manchus leading the country
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
The Manchus were descended from the Jurchen Jin dynasty rulers who had
taken north China during Song times. The Manchu forces were the most
capable and well-disciplined in the empire.
\end{quote}

But! It's not even like that's the problem, anyway.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Larger military threats from the Mongols were also paired with party
  \emph{infighting}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Zheng He became sacrifice for
    infighting{[}{[}KBhHIST201ChinasDeclineWRTZhengHe{]}{]}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Êú±Ê££'s son aligned with faction opposing him
    \item
      So, he canceled the voyages as a show of strength
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
They had become a target in political infighting---one bureaucratic
faction championing them, another trying to take down the first by
decrying their expense \ldots{} Yongle's son and successor aligned with
the faction that opposed his father's policies.
\end{quote}

The mongol attacks, as admitted by Kennedy, are pretty bad. However,
they \emph{never really left}, so its not a one-time problem that could,
as per the language of Kennedy, simply be ``reconsidered'' after its, as
inferred by Kennedy, \emph{delt with.}

Furthermore, saying that the voyages' costs are too high are a mask for
a bigger (or, in some respects, smaller?) problem --- that its simply
political tribalism within the Ming court decrying the prices of these
attacks trying to hide the tribalism itself; so\ldots{} this would no be
solved even after the Mongols are gone --- they will simply find
something else to blame or the emperor will just\ldots{} die and switch
faction.

\textbf{Conservative Confucian government ‚â† No Trade!}

Han Salt and Iron Debate =\textgreater{} ``good ol' times'' according to
Kennedy, no? 81 AD

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Confucians actually arguing \emph{against} central control and
  monopolies
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
The purpose of merchants is circulation and the purpose of artisans is
making tools. These matters should not become a major concern of the
government.
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Kennedy indeed \emph{misinterpreted} the Confucian view

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{Governments} should not be \textbf{concerned} with trade
  \item
    Natural trade --- without an emphasis on profit from the government
    --- should neither be encouraged nor disencouraged
  \item
    Does not mean monopoly and limit
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
When profit is not emphasized, civilization flourishes and the customs
of the people improve. \ldots{} At present the government ignores what
people have and exacts what they lack. The common people then must sell
their products cheaply to satisfy the demands of the government.
\ldots{} Quick traders and unscrupulous officials buy when goods are
cheap in order to make high profits.
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Confucian tenant is not to limit trade, Kennedy Style, instead, focus
  on limitation of market forces

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Additional restrictions on trade causes citizens to pander to the
    trader + causing hyperdeflation =\textgreater{} this actually
    happened!

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      China closed trade after Zheng He, smugglers became rampant
    \item
      Even Kennedy acknowledged this\ldots{}

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        Fujian actively invited smugglers to sustain trade
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
Fujian depended on the sea \ldots{} when international trade was
officially banned, Fujianese found themselves in an uncomfortable
position---there was nothing for them on land \ldots{} {[}So{]}
Fujianese traders invited three thousand Japanese and Portuguese
smugglers to reoccupy the former Dutch base at Wu Island.
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Market economy, and \emph{not morality} takes over, against Confucian
  principles
\end{itemize}

Kennedy incorrectly interpreted the viewpoint of trade from the
Confucian perspective. Through the Salt and Iron debates, Confucian
scholars indeed is trying to convince a struggling Han dynasty
\emph{from} imposing a strict trade limitation. This is because the
central Confucian tenant of \emph{morality} warrents merchants to stay
in their place --- promoting circulation --- and not driving market
economies. Through imposing a trade ban, the Confucian philosophers
rightly believe that it would cause a hyperdeflation --- causing
merchants to have more opportunity to ``wrongly'' prosper.

\hypertarget{defluffifying}{%
\subsection{Defluffifying}\label{defluffifying}}

Again, here's Kennedy:

\begin{quote}
China had decided to turn its back on the world {[}after Zheng He's
expedition of 1433{]}\ldots{} There was \ldots{} a plausible strategical
reason for this decision. The northern frontiers of the empire were
again under some pressure from the Mongols \ldots{} Yet {[}stopping
maritime activity{]} \ldots{} does not appear to have been reconsidered
when the disadvantages \ldots{} became clear: within a century or so,
the Chinese coastline and even cities on the Yangtze were being attacked
by Japanese pirates\ldots{} Therefore, a key element in China's retreat
was the sheer conservatism of the Confucian bureaucracy \ldots{} In
{[}the Ming's{]} ``Restoration'' atmosphere, the all-important
officialdom was concerned to preserve and recapture the past, not to
create a brighter future.
\end{quote}

\emph{In Kennedy's claim of China relying on conservative Confucianism
being the driving force behind China's closing of its maritime
activities, the author fails to recognize the difficulty of sustaining
trade in a falling economy, political infighting blamed on stenthening
rebels, and in fact misinterpreates the Confucian philisophies of trade
--- creating a faulty argument}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Economic reopening can't save China in the long run in a failing
  economy, making reopening less effective as claimed
\item
  Mongols are threat that never was ``resolved'', and hence here used as
  a scapegoat for bigger political infighting
\item
  Confucianism embraced trade as a means to allow goods circulation, so
  emulating traditional Confucian philosophy does not mean shutting
  trade down
\end{itemize}

Now, defluffify by re-writing the three points + so what in as little
words as possible.

\textbf{In Robert Kennedy's claim of the traditionalist Confucian
reasoning behind the Ming government's halting of maritime activities
after Zheng He's voyage of 1433, Kennedy cast a faulty argument that not
only ignores both the ineffectiveness of reopening trade and the Ming
court's usage of Mongolian invasions as scapegoat for political
infighting but also misinterprets the central moral tenant of Confucian
philosophy that favors natural market circulation as a complete
ideological ban on trade.}
