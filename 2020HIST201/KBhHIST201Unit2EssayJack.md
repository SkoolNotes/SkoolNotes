 In the end, did the European balance of power succeed in its goal to, as Kissinger puts it, limit conflict and produce the “best possible outcome” from flawed human nature? Or did it magnify conflict and increase the likelihood of global war?
 
 ## Quotable Quotes
 
 * Kissinger
	 *  "If the circumstances were reversed, we could equally be pro-German and anti-French." A1
	 * "William was perfectly willing to negotiate with Louis XIV when he felt the balance of power could best be served by doing so." A2
	 * "Agreeing on the importance of the balance of power did not, however, still British disputes about the best strategy to implement the policy. ... The Whigs argued that GB should engage only when balance threatened, and only long enough to remove threat; Tories argued that GB's duty was to _shape_ the balance of power." A3
	* CLAIM: "Of course, in the end a balance of power always comes about de facto when several states interact." A4
	* "Power is too difficult to assess, and the willingness to vindicate it too various, to permit treating it as a reliable guide to international order. ... The balance of power inhibits the capacity to overthrow the international order" A5
	* "Every king consoled himself with the thought that strengthening his own rule was the greatest possible contribution to the general peace, and left it to the ubiquitous invisible hand to justify his exertions - without limiting his ambitions." A6
	* "But Louis XN gained no peace. of mind from security; he saw in it an opportunity for conquest. In his overzealous pursuit of raison d'etat, LouisXN alarmed the rest of Europe and brought together an anti-French coalition which, in the end, thwarted his design." A7
	* "Thereby, France lost the advantage of having adversaries constrained by moral considerations ...  Once all states played by the same rules, gains became much more difficult to achieve" A8
	
* Roberts
	* "In the next four centuries, Christianity was often to have disastrous effects. Confident in the possession of the true religion, Europeans were impatient and contemptuous of the values and achievements of the peoples and civilizations they disturbed." A9
	* "Greed quickly led to the abuse of power, to domination and exploitation by force. In the end this led to great crimes - though they were often committed unconsciously." A10
	* "Europeans could usually exact what they wanted in the end because of a technical superiority which exaggerated the power of their tiny numbers and for a few centuries turned the balance against the great historic agglomerations of population and civilization." A11
	* "The obscuring of the Company's primary commercial role was not good for business. It also gave its employees even greater opportunities to feather their own nests. ... the British government hoped as fervently as the Company to avoid being dragged any further into the role of imperial power in India." A12
	* "The huge and growing Caribbean market for slaves and imported European goods was added to that already offered by a Spanish empire increasingly unable to defend its economic monopoly. This fixed the role of the West Indies in the relationships of the European powers for the next century. ... They were long a prey to disorder" A13
	* "Gradually, the great powers fought out their disputes until they arrived at acceptable agreements, but this was to take a long time." A14
	* "All the colonial powers had, by the eighteenth century, been able to extract some economic profit from their colonies" A15
	* "Europeans did not just conquer; they exterminated local cultures and peoples and replaced them with their own" A16
	* "Older cultures were to be cut off from populating the new worlds or setting their mark on them" A17
	* "The French were Great Britain's most dangerous potential competitors, but their government was always likely to be distracted by its European continental commitments." A18
	* "The British lacked missionary zeal ... they had no immediate urge to interfere with the native custom or institution" A19

* Mason
	* "A long struggle between Parliament and the Stuart kings [in England?] and essentially replaced the absolute monarchy with a constitutional monarchy" A22
	* "'Sovereign power resides in my person alone .... It is from me alone that my policies take their existence and their authority'" A23
	* "European monarchies had consciously pursued a policy of the balance of power, a system of shifting international alliances that prevented any one country from becoming too powerful" A24
	* "Wars were fought not so much for ideology or nationalism but to maintain the balance of power ... The victor did not want to crush the vanquished" A25

	* "The French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars had unleashed forces that would shake the foundations of European society. " A27

	* "Napoleon's military fortunes began to wane ... The allied armies pressed on, entered Paris, and forced Napoleon to abdicate" A32
	
* Our Surprise Friend Kennedy
	* Europe had always been politically fragmented, despite even the best efforts of the Romans A33 => Europe is politically fragmented
	* For this political diversity Europe had largely to thank its geography. There were no enormous plains over which an empire of horse men could impose its swift dominion; nor were there broad and fertile zones ... providing the food for masses of toiling and easily conquerable peasants A34 => Europe is A33 because of its unique geography
	* The fact was that in Europe there were always some princes and local lords willing to tolerate merchants and their ways even when others plundered and expelled them A35 => Europe had mixed variety of local ideals that often conflicted with each other
	
* Balance of power only encourages fighting when provoked
* Entropy, so people provoke
* But ultimately its more stable than old world empires	
	
* It encourages fighting, but that's unavoidable
	* Competing resources
	* Competing land
	* Competing trade 
	
* BOP naturally create conflict
* But these conflicts are still better/necessary than normal war
* BP 2
	* Napolean
	* England, too + their overseas
* Better BP3 =>

## Claim Synthesis
*Although the European balance of power does lead to frequent competitive conflict — like that between France and England — it ultimately is both naturally unavoidable and the best outcome for generally peaceful international policy*

* To BOP, constant adjustments must be made, and they often involve conflict
	* We got to our current Euro-centric world b/c European nations, through leveraging its technical superiority, upset the balance of power in acient countries A11
	* They did they b/c our good friend Raison de etat. Every king believes that acting in his self intrest strengthened general peace A6, but greed lead to unconcious crimes A10
	* Indeed, too many countries Raisoning may lead to countries unrestrained by morality A8 to achieve the bestest they could
	* But to actually achieve "the best", we need to constantly adjust the balance:
		* Before the 7 years war, Britian and France still fought even nominally at peace A20
		* all the colonial powers had, by the eighteenth century, been able to extract some economic profit from their colonies A15 
* These small adjustments are, although potentially brutal, completely necessary
	* No agreement? Fight! Eventually there will be one. A14
	* Because europeans intentionally set up goverment to prevent one from being too powerful A24
	* What adjustments? Tracing Napolean:
		* France was baaad: A31
		* The Enlightment happpened (need quote?) Which seeks to BOP
			* French Rev shaked europe A27
			* napolean tried to spread ideas of the revolution A26
			* How did he fade? He got balance-of-powered A32 again b/c he was being too good at this emperor-not-an-emperor thing.
		* Net positive? Hard to tell. But! At that time, this was natural and inevitable: we got from Louis to Louis, but it is from A31 Louis to A30 better Louis
	* A33 Europe has always been geographically fragmented, so one has to keep fighting to maintain balance	
* BOP is heavily Euro-centric, and won't work elseware
	* When the same countries were fighting in European and foreign wars, they would much rather do it in Europe
		* Competition in French and English colony in India often set aside for mainland competition A18, why? because of colonized land having A34 unique and large resources that make them easier to conqure
		* A35: in Europe, no unified ideas, but not (EVIDENCE) in conquered places
	* The big-BOP Britons did not want to assimilate in the Indeas A19 when it is not in their intrests
	* 

<!--* England was always the mediator (QUOTENEEDED)-->

## Defluffifying
*Although the European balance of power does lead to frequent competitive conflict — like that between France and England — it ultimately is both naturally unavoidable and evolved to fit European power dynamics*

* European BOP lead to frequent conflict
* BOP is naturally unavoidable
* it is uniquely European, making global BOP-caused war unlikely

So what? SO WHAT

Now, defluffify by re-writing the three points + so what in as little words as possible.

**Although the Balance-of-Power leads to frequent "adjustments" of balance in the shape of minor conflicts, this system is uniquely unavoidable in European politics (sounds like kennedy) and hence will not contribute to global war due to its European nature.**
