It also gave its employees even greater opportunities to feather their own nests. ... the British government hoped as fervently as the Company to avoid being dragged any further into the role of imperial power in India." A12
	* "The huge and growing Caribbean market for slaves and imported European goods was added to that already offered by a Spanish empire increasingly unable to defend its economic monopoly. This fixed the role of the West Indies in the relationships of the European powers for the next century. ... They were long a prey to disorder" A13
	* "Gradually, the great powers fought out their disputes until they arrived at acceptable agreements, but this was to take a long time." A14

	* "'Sovereign power resides in my person alone .... It is from me alone that my policies take their existence and their authority'" A23
	* "European monarchies had consciously pursued a policy of the balance of power, a system of shifting international alliances that prevented any one country from becoming too powerful" A24
