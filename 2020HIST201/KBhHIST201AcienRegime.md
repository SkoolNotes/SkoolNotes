# Acien Régime

## Societal Structure
 Strict grid of social hierarchy resulted due to birthright => Great Chain of Being
 
**Great Chain of Being**
* Entire world organized structurally
* God at the top, rocks at the bottom
* In which, King on the top — God's divine representative ("L'état c'est moi" — the state is me)
		* French societies organized into three castes — "estates"
			* First Estate => clergy; enjoyed high status
			* Second Estate => aristocracy; provided military and monetary support
				* *Les Grands*: largest landholders w/ large houses
				* *Seigneurs*: provincial nobles who simply owned estates in the countryside
			* Third Estate => 97% of the population
				* Production!
				* Reproduction!
