French societies organized into three castes — "estates".

* **First Estate** => clergy; enjoyed high status
* **Second Estate** => aristocracy; provided military and monetary support
	* *Les Grands*: largest landholders w/ large houses
	* *Seigneurs*: provincial nobles who simply owned estates in the countryside
* **Third Estate** => 97% of the population
	* Production!
	* Reproduction!
	* Work!
	* Relatively prosperous, but <40% owned land
	* Most rented land from lords as tenant farmers/sharecroppers

	* No national currency, nor system of weights and measures, nor a market

			*  Church owned large amount of resources => almost 10%
