- Kennedy
	- Rise / Strengths
		- says that the ottomans threats and wars seemed part of an coherent grand strategy and the Europeans were disjointed and sporadic {p4}
		- Early 16th century china turned in on itself, but the ottomans did not. In middle staged of expansion
		- Ottomans were the greatest muslim threat to Europe becuase of their army and their superior seige train. {p9} 
		- Applied pressure to europe {p9}
		- Had a great navel power, won a bunch of battles, raided a bunch of places with their navy. 
		- Had an offical fath, culture, and language over an area greater than the romans.
		- Were way more advanced in tech and culture
		- Large tolererance of other races led to influx of talented people {p10}
	- Fall / Weaknesses 
		- Eventually turned inward
		- Hard for army to expand due to immense cost 
		- Ottoman imperialism wasn't that profitable 
		- second half of 16th century, showed signs of "strategical over-extenstion" {p11}
		- Shi'ite kingdom was prepared to ally with the Europeans against the Ottomans 
		- Needed good leadership, but after 1566, there was 13 incompetent Sultans in a row.
		- Centralized, despotic, "orthodix in its attitude towards initiative, disent, and commerce"
		- > An idiot sultan could paralyze the Ottoman empire in the way that a pope or Holy Roman emperor could never do for all Europe. {p12}
		- > Without clear directives from above, the arteries of the bureaucracy hardened, preferring conservatism to change, and stifling innovation.  
		- Poverty -> internal plundering 
			- Lack of expanstion and hence riches combined with the "vast rise in prices" caused janissaries to "turn to internal plunder"
			- Merchants and entrapanuers were met with unpredictable tax rates and "outright seuizure of property"
			- Soldiers raded peasants land, peasants also turned to plundering, eveerything went downhill. 
		- Shi'ite religions made officials crack down on free thought
			- Printing press was forbidden 
			- > Economic notions remained primitive
				- Imports desired, but exports were forbidden 
				- Didn't like innovation or rise of capitalism
				- Religions didn't like traders. 
			- Kept old methods of dealing with plagues, and suffered from more epidemics due to it.
			- > Their armed services had become, indeed, a bastion of conservatism. 
	- Main Ideas:
		- Infighting
			- expansion
				- Iron first tactic of crushing others led to them uniting against the ottomans
				- Harder to keep expanding, imperialism was no longer profitable 
				- Needed good leadership / new direction, but heavy centralization allowed for a single "idiot" leader to stall the empire completely. This happened thirteen times in a row. 
				- This made bureaucracy harden, which led to a culture of conservatism
				- Lack of income lead to infighting and plundering 
				- Threat from Shi'ite religions led to cracking down on free thought 
					- Stifled innovation + income  
					- More plagues 

- Bulliet 
	- > These periods of change reveal the problems faced by huge, land based empires around the world 
	- Rise 
		- Grew because of: {486}
			- The shrewdness of its founders and their descendents 
			- Control of a strategic link between Europe and asia 
			- Army that took advantage of the traditional skills of the turkish cavalryman presented by gunpowder and christian prisoner of war
		- Navy was helpful...? Had a weak navy...?   
		- Late 1400s, got christian slaves to use as a valuable resource
		- Taxed male children for warriors {p489}
	- Fall 
		-  Crisis of the military state
			- Newer tech -> greater importance of cannons and light weight fire arms 
			- late 16th century, influx of silver led to inflation, landholders couldn't report for military duty {490}
			- Canvalrymen reduced / put out of buisness, replaced with janissary corps.
			- Also scholars suffered from reduced income\
			- Cannot fundementaly alter tax system due to religous law. 
			- Government recruited short term soldies which were out of money when the campaign ended
			- > Former landholding cavalrymen, short-term soldiers released at the end of a campaign, peasants overburdened by emergency taxes, and even impoverished students of religion formed bands of marauders. 
		- Economic change and growing weakness
			- Kept sultans confined to the palace so they woudnt start coups 
				- led to them not being experienced with the real world
			- Janissaries used their increased power to make privliges in their corps hereditary 
		- Inflation due to a massive influx of silver hit people with fixed incomes hard
			- Such as, cavalrymen holding land grants 
			- Students on fixed scholarships {~493}
		- Army was weakening, clear by the middle of the 18th century 
		- Trade agreements led to the Europeans dominating the Ottomans in seaborne trade {494}
		- Tulip period...? 
		- Central governments weakness allowed smaller leaders to fragment the nation.
		- > Although no region declared full independence, the sultan's power was slipping away to the advantage of a broad array of lower officials and upstart chieftains in all parts of the empire while the Ottoman economy was reorienting itself toward Europe.  
	- Main Ideas
		- Inflation
			- Influx of silver led to soldiers and students with fixed salaries starving 
			- Only mention of conservatism (probs): coudn't fundamentally change tax system due to religious law 
		- Formed bands of marauders 
		- Trade agreements allowed the Europeans to dominate in seaborne Trade
