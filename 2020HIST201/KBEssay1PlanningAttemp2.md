- Kennedy
	- Rise / Strengths

		- Early 16th century china turned in on itself, but the ottomans did not. In middle staged of expansion
		- Ottomans were the greatest muslim threat to Europe becuase of their army and their superior seige train. {p9} 
		- Applied pressure to europe {p9}

		- Had an offical faith, culture, and language over an area greater than the romans.
		- Were way more advanced in tech and culture
		- Large tolererance of other races led to influx of talented people {p10}
	- Fall / Weaknesses

- Bulliet 
	- > These periods of change reveal the problems faced by huge, land based empires around the world 
	- Rise 
		- Grew because of: {486}
			- The shrewdness of its founders and their descendents 
			- Control of a strategic link between Europe and asia 
			- Army that took advantage of the traditional skills of the turkish cavalryman presented by gunpowder and christian prisoner of war
		- Navy was helpful...? Had a weak navy...?   
		- Late 1400s, got christian slaves to use as a valuable resource
		- Taxed male children for warriors {p489}
	- Fall 
		-  Crisis of the military state
			- Newer tech -> greater importance of cannons and light weight fire arms 
			- late 16th century, influx of silver led to inflation, landholders couldn't report for military duty {490}
			- Canvalrymen reduced / put out of buisness, replaced with janissary corps.
			- Also scholars suffered from reduced income\
			- Cannot fundementaly alter tax system due to religous law. 
			- Government recruited short term soldiers which were out of money when the campaign ended
			- > Former landholding cavalrymen, short-term soldiers released at the end of a campaign, peasants overburdened by emergency taxes, and even impoverished students of religion formed bands of marauders. 
		- Economic change and growing weakness
			- Kept sultans confined to the palace so they woudnt start coups 
				- led to them not being experienced with the real world
			- Janissaries used their increased power to make privliges in their corps hereditary 
		- Inflation due to a massive influx of silver hit people with fixed incomes hard
			- Such as, cavalrymen holding land grants 
			- Students on fixed scholarships {~493}
		- Army was weakening, clear by the middle of the 18th century 
		- Trade agreements led to the Europeans dominating the Ottomans in seaborne trade {494}
		- Tulip period...? 
		- Central governments weakness allowed smaller leaders to fragment the nation.
		- > Although no region declared full independence, the sultan's power was slipping away to the advantage of a broad array of lower officials and upstart chieftains in all parts of the empire while the Ottoman economy was reorienting itself toward Europe.  
	- Main Ideas
		- Inflation
			- Influx of silver led to soldiers and students with fixed salaries starving 
			- Only mention of conservatism (probs): coudn't fundamentally change tax system due to religious law 
		- Formed bands of marauders 
		- Trade agreements allowed the Europeans to dominate in seaborne Trade
		- Central government allowed smaller leaders to fragment the nation

Though Kennedy and Bulliet have differing emphasis, they largely agree on three overarching reasons on why the Ottoman Empire fell. These reasons include ineffective and irrational leadership, poverty and overexpansion.  



Kennedy places emphasis on the nature of the Ottoman's governmental system, claiming that irrational leadership led to choking bureaucracy and a culture of anti-innovation. One of the many deficits of a heavily centralized government was that a single "idiot sultan could paralyze the Ottoman Empire"(ken). Kennedy claims that there were thirteen of these "idiot sultan[s]" in a row, making the "the arteries of the bureaucracy harden[...], stifling innovation." With an irrational leader, the only defense against punishment is closely following the rules and not making any personal judgment. Civilians are forced to be bureaucratic out of concern for their own safety, and this concern was what allowed the bureaucracy and anti-innovative mindset to permeate through the culture so effectively. Considering that Kennedy and Bulliet both agree that innovation and effective leaders led to the rise of the Ottoman empire, it's safe to assume that they would agree that the lack of both would contribute to the fall of the empire(holy shit thats fucked). These causes of the Ottoman's rise to power is also supported by a travelogue written by an elite court-born Ottoman, which describes the government-ordered destruction of an old gun foundry for a new one as exemplifying "human strength and intelligence." This sentiment clearly shows the value that the Ottomans placed in strong leadership and innovation. 

Bulliet's main emphasis falls on the increasing poverty of the Ottoman empire. While Kennedy and Bulliet agree on the importance and negative effects of poverty, they do not agree on its cause. Bulliet claims that poverty was primarily a product of inflation which was "caused by a flood of cheap silver from the new world," whereas Kennedy claims that it was because "Ottoman imperialism [...] did not bring much in the way of economic benefit," as overextenstion led to immense costs in further expansion Regardless, they agree that this poverty led to internal plunder, unpredictable tax rates, and "outright seizure of property." Bulliet describes how the poverty hit those with fixed incomes especially hard, such as cavalrymen and scholars. Due to the reduced income of cavalrymen, many were not able to participate in wars. To manage the army's reduced numbers, the government hired short term soldiers which were "out of work and short on cash" once the campaign season ended. In order to pay off the Janissaries, the government immensely increased taxes. In response "former landholding cavalrymen, short-term soldiers released at the end of a campaign, peasants overburdened by emergency taxes, and even impoverished students of religion formed bands of marauders." This behavior is also mentioned by Sir William Eton in *A Survey of the Turkish Empire*, where he mentions that the "Turks [...] are seditious and mutinous." 


Finally, Kennedy and Bulliet agree that the Ottoman Empire was unable to present a united front near the end of its lifespan, though they disagree on why this is. Bulliet argues that due to the ineffective government and immense poverty present in the nation, the Ottoman Empire unofficially split apart: "in the provinces, ambitious and competent governors, wealthy landholders, urban notables, and nomad chieftains took advantage of the central government's weakness. [...] Commanders had become virtually independent rulers." The once centralized government had now split into many smaller pieces which the Sultan did not exhibit much control over. The nature of the fracturing meant that each individual kingdom was not well interconnected, a vital aspect of functioning decentralized governments. This specific type of fracturing left the empire unable to achieve change quickly due to its strangling bureaucracy and sheer lack of resources, and unable to present a unified front against enemies uniting against them. Kennedy neglects to mention this splitting, and instead focus on the many plagues the empire experienced. Kennedy states that because the Ottomans were "contemptuous of European ideas and practices, the Turks declined to adopt newer methods for containing plagues," and were hit with sever epidemics because of it. These plagues considerably hindered the Ottoman Empire's ability to create an effective, united army.
