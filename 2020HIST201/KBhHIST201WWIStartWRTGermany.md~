# Germany's Provokations in WWI
Germany's quick success is a little scary for folks because they are used to standard European power structures; this is also scary for Bismark (Chancellor of Germany) because he wanted to keep peace.

- Otto von Bismark feared that the new Germany could be broken by war, so tried to keep peace.
	- Bismark signed two sets of treaties. The first forming the **Triple Alliance**, which lead to the alliance of AustriaHungary, Italy, and Germany. 
	- Also signed a second reverse insurance treaty with Russia, an enemy of the first.
	- The reverse insurance alliance with Russia was way to finagly, which lead to it collapsing under Bismarkâ€™s successors and eventually lead to France signing a treaty with Russia.
