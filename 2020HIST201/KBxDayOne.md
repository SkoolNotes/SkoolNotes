# Here. We. Go.


- Why does war exist? Are they products of failure in other realms or logical products of global systems?
    - war has heavy economic benifits -- war is heaviliy profitable 
    - war for resources, war for morality -- "this is right, and we will fight for it!" 
		- I missed this: war for social cohession? whats the broader catagory? 
	- also war for resources disuised as war for morality


- What would be required to put an end to war?
    - heaviliy dependent on the war, and the nature of the war. 
    - very importyant question. one side conceding would do it. 
    - running out of financial resource? end by exaustion? 
    - wars end when one side gives up (not when one side wins). 
	
	- I READ TRHE QUESTION WRONG: I read it as a war
	- war the way we know it is ending, due to MAD. 


- Is there such a thing as a just (or good, ethical, righteous) war? Why/why not?
    - this is not a question i am prepared to answer while still debating the very meaning of 'good.' 
    - utilitarian perspective, if the war reduces overall pain or suffering (bad?) then yes, it is good.
    - if going to war is the choice of the people, ..

**In groups, discuss and compare your ideas on the origins of war, the possibilities of its eradication, and its justness/unjustness. 

Look for points of agreement and disagreement and be prepared to share.**
