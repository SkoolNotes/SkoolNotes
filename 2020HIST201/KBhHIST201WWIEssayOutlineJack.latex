The political scientist Kenneth Waltz argues that the causes of war can
be analyzed at three different levels: the individual human level, the
state level, and the international system level. Those who view things
from the first level believe that war is best explained by
``selfishness,'' ``misdirected aggressive impulses,'' or ``stupidity''
within the human psyche. Those who favor the second level believe there
are hostile or aggressive or revisionist states who, because of their
form of government or other domestic issues, behave in a warlike manner
while other states simply want to keep the peace (the status quo). Those
who favor the third level believe that the international system itself,
because it is an anarchy with ``no system of law enforceable'' between
states, and in which each state acts according to its own interest and
reserves the right to use force to achieve its aims, makes war
inevitable.

\textbf{Analyze World War 1 according to one (or a blend) of these
levels of analysis. Make an argument that combines an explanation of the
general causes of the war with the specific sequence of events
(including events that prolonged the war beyond the initial outbreak).}

  ``He formed a military alliance with Austria-Hungary, to which Italy
  was added in 1882. Bismarck signed a `reinsurance' treaty with Russia
  also. Since Russia and Austria were enemies (because ofthe Balkans),
  to be allied to both at the same time took considerable diplomatic
  finesse.'' AA
\item
  ``They had long prided themselves on a `splendid isolation,' going
  their own way, disdaining the kind of dependency that alliance with
  others always brings'' AB
\item
  ``The older Triple Alliance faced a newer Triple Entente, the latter
  somewhat the looser, since the British refused to make any formal
  military commitments.'' AC
\item
  ``In 1904 the British and French governments agreed to forget Fashoda
  and the accumulated bad feeling of the preceding 25 years. \ldots{}
  There was no specific alliance; neither side said what it would do in
  the event ofwar; it was only a close understanding, an entente
  cordiale.'' AD
\item
  ``They would call an international conference, at which Russia would
  favor Austrian annexation of Bosnia, and Austria would support the
  opening of the Straits to Russian warships. Austria, without waiting
  for a conference, proclaimed the annexation ofBosnia without more
  ado\ldots{} Isvolsky was never able to realize his plans for
  Constantinople. His partners in the Triple Entente, Britain and
  France, refused to back him.'' AE
\item
  ``An agreement of the great powers, to keep the peace, conjured up an
  independent kingdom in Albania. This confirmed the Austrian policy,
  kept Serbia from the sea, and aroused vehement outcries in both Serbia
  and Russia. But Russia again backed down. Serbian expansionism was
  again frustrated and inflamed.'' AF
\item
  ``Arthur Zim- mermann, dispatched a telegram to the German minister at
  Mexico City, telling him what to say to the Mexican president. He was
  to say that if the United States went to war with Germany. Germany
  would form an alliance with Mexico and if possible Japan, enabling
  Mexico to get back its `lost territories.' \ldots{} Zimmermann's
  telegram was intercepted and decoded by the British, and passed on to
  them to Washington. Printed in the newspapers, it shocked public
  opinion in the United States.'' AG
\item
  ``By the end of 1917 the submarine was no more than a nuisance. For
  the Germans the great plan produced the anticipated penalty without
  the reward---its net result was only to add America to their
  enemies.'' AH
\item
  ``The Germans, issuing their famous `blank check,' encouraged the
  Austrians to be firm. The Austrians, thus reassured, dispatched a
  drastic ultimatum to Serbia'' AI
\item
  ``France, terrified at the possibility ofbeing some day caught alone
  in a warwith Germany and determined to keep Russia as an ally at any
  cost, in effect gave a blank check to Russia.'' AJ
\item
  ``The first victim ofthe First World War, among governments, was the
  Russian empire'' AK

\textbf{Instead of leveraging a more passive strategy of defense to
maintain peace, European nations in the early 19th century chose a more
active role for national security though compromising peacekeeping
agreements, preemptive use of absolute force, and subversive deals with
opposition that resulted in the disruption of preset balances of power
and lead to World War I.}
