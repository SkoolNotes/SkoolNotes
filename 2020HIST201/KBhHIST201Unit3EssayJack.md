# Industrial Revolution Essay
## General Information
| Due Date | Topic | Important Documents |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Friday, December 18th | 19th Century Transformations | Mason, Bulliet, Ropp, and Gelvin |

## Prompt
**What factor or factors most strongly determined which states would become "winners" and "losers" in this time period (1815 to roughly 1900)?** 

- Address several examples
- Show wins (GB, Japan, Germany, Italy) and show losses (Egypt, India, China, SEA, Africa)

## Preparation
* **Erosion of tariff barrieriers + widespread free trade ideals** => new international order
	* vs. Ottomans' promotion of control
* Reliance on artisan and manual manufacturing instead of high-tech IR stuff => decline! b/c higher tech means more ability to leverage [[KBhHIST201IRonWarfare]]
	* Germany and Italy used high-tech warfare to get their dominance ([[KBhHIST201MasonAndKennedy]])
* IR created a discrepancy of technology, which is difficult to fight back from using old-style technology.

* Winning strategy: nationalism. Loosing strategy: soverignty control (the Ottomans again) + seperatism

| Concept | Winning Solution | Loosing Solution | 
|---|---|---|
| Modern warfare | Approaching industrialization and all the new-fangled [[KBhHIST201IRonWarfare]] that it brings, like what happened to the British Royal Navy | how much, or centrol control  | 
| Trading | Erosion of tariff barriers + widespread free trade ideals (a la European city-states) | Controlling trade (a la the Ottomans' defense developmentalism) |
| State organization | Germany's [[KBhHIST201GermanicNationalism]] | Dynastarial control a la China; weak emperors => downfall |

### Quotes bin, too!
* "Prussian success was due in large measure to the application of new technologies to logistics and warfare"   @[[KBhHIST201MasonCh7]] AA
* "Despite a steady reduction in its own numbers after 1815, the Royal Navy was at some times probably as powerful as the next three or four navies in actual fighting power. " @[[KBhHIST201KennedyCh4]] BA
* "The firepower gap, like that which had opened up in industrial productivity, meant that the leading nations possessed resources fifty or a hundred times greater than those at the bottom." @[[KBhHIST201KennedyCh4]] BB
* "The advanced technology of steam engines and machine-made tools gave Europe decisive economic and military advantages." @[[KBhHIST201KennedyCh4]] BC
* "the steam-driven gunboat meant that European sea power, already supreme in open waters, could be extended inland. ... The ironclad _Nemesis ... was a disaster for the defending Chinese forces, which were easily brushed aside." @[[KBhHIST201KennedyCh4]] BD

## Claim Synthesis
Three aspects: embracing Industrialization-tech based military warfare that originated in Europe; promoting free trade and market economy; organizing states under civic top-down nationalism.

### Modern Warfare
England, through utilizing [[KBhHIST201IRonWarfare]], was able to gather a huge competitive advantage over other nations.

BC â€” new tech made military much better. They did two things: they made the navy much more economically and physically efficient but also just made them good ol' fashioned  _better_.

Per the BA, the British royal navy was actually able to have a huge boost in fighting power even while reducing its count during the 1810s. 

Such efficiencies is unrivaled even compared to the traditionally large nations. By embracing the [[KBhHIST201IndustrialRevolution]], new conquirings are possible that would not have been possible before. BD against traditionally large nations that simply did not had the speed to embrace and master [[KBhHIST201IRonWarfare]].

### Free Trade
