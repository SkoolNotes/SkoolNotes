# The Effect of Industrial Revolution on Warfare
@Kennedy [[KBhHIST201MasonAndKennedy]]

**Industrial/technical change affected war outcome more than finances**

* War's emphasis was placed on wining fast instead of long-term mobilization + revenue => CLAIM rending finances less important

Modern technology increased the rate of fire + created the invention of light field artillery.

* Prevented the indigenous people from fighting back using the old technology
* European seapower could extend inland, and eventually lead to the Opium War
* **Some in the middle east was able to adopt the European fighting technique, but China, for instance, could not**
* The "gunpower gap" created that nations would have hundreds of times the capacity to fight compared to they did before
