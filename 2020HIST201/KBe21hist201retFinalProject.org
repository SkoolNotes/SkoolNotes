* mechanisms of planned obscelescence
** contrived durability (key parts made out of eg. plastic)
** percieved obselescence: colors + shape changes
** systemic obselescence: ports / standards being changed
** programmed obselescence: dropping support for old versions
** bloatware obselescence: requiring vastly more hardware to make old devices slow
** legal obselescence: eg. emissions limits on cars
** repair prevention seals + screws
** repair preventaion construction (hard to access batteries)

** percieved obselescence
*** "embrace the notch"
*** repeated changes to bezels
*** repeated changes to camera configuration
*** repeated changes to colors
** programmed obselescence
*** dropping support
*** bloatware
** repair prevention
*** seals (glue)

*** battery replacement/integration
*** glued and hard-to-access connectors
* arguments for these types of obselescence
** its okay if battery fades, bc tech develops so quickly
** constant purchasing allows tech to develop faster
