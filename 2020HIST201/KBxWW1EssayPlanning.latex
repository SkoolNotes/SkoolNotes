\begin{verbatim}
**

The political scientist Kenneth Waltz argues that the causes of war can be analyzed at three different levels: the individual human level, the state level, and the international system level. Those who view things from the first level believe that war is best explained by “selfishness,” “misdirected aggressive impulses,” or “stupidity” within the human psyche. Those who favor the second level believe there are hostile or aggressive or revisionist states who, because of their form of government or other domestic issues, behave in a warlike manner while other states simply want to keep the peace (the status quo). Those who favor the third level believe that the international system itself, because it is an anarchy with “no system of law enforceable” between states, and in which each state acts according to its own interest and reserves the right to use force to achieve its aims, makes war inevitable. 

  

Analyze World War 1 according to one (or a blend) of these levels of analysis. Make an argument that combines an explanation of the general causes of the war with the specific sequence of events (including events that prolonged the war beyond the initial outbreak). I would suggest using a chronological organization to your essay.

levels of analysis:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  individual
\item
  state
\item
  systemic
\end{itemize}

example: put an egg in a highway, do you blame the car that chrushes it?

how do we think about inevitability?

relative usefullness of each one

how do they intersect? system provides inevitability, but is that
emergent out of the qualities of the individual?

potential essay: top down, each one informs the next. simply map to
analysis levels

claim: not actully three seperate levels? higher up levels cannot be
generated withought the previous?

systems need to account for randomness, which is inevitable. thus,
higher level analysis?

the fact that ferdinand dying caused this meant that there was a higher
level issue?

systems: random chance events will happen

was it a random chance event? was this the `natural progression of
things'?

or is the aproach, `random chance events are inevitable (in a system
with so many actors), thus the system must be set up for this? or it is
part of the system?'

top down:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  because of this system, it was inevitable that a state would act out.
\item
  lets look at this state. because of this state, it was inevitable that
  a person would act out
\item
  lets look at that person
\item
  discuss merits of different levels of analysis?
\end{itemize}

bottom up:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  this person did this, and that caused the war.
\end{itemize}

usefullness of analysis at different levels?

war is a local minima in the system

nukes have allowed us to jump peaks and reach a lower minima

warring state has incentive to bring allies into war

non warring states have incentive to allie with winning side and gain
power with them, as well as prevent others from becoming to powerful --
BOP dynamic from resan detant

this brings the entire system into war

as more actors join into the war, you MUST join the war. one side of the
war will win, and massively gain power. you cannot stay at your old
divided power level.

just as peace is an emergent property of raison detant (BOP), global war
can be as well? easily ``excitable''

prisoners dillema sqaure, when tensions are high, best desition is to
attack. also best descition to bring allies, and best desition for
allies to join in. tragedy of the commons. war breaks out

system has changed, MAD has allowed us to jump peaks to a lower minima.

war only breaks out when tenstions are high, otherwise you would just
defend.

once tensions become high, war becomes inevitable, and can be triggered
at the smallest event.

      On June 28, 1914, a young Bosnian revolutionary, a member of the
      Serbian secret soci ety called ``Union of Death'' and commonly

        The Germans, issuing their famous ``blank check,'' encouraged
        the Austrians to be firm.
      \item
        The Austrians, thus reassured, dispatched a drastic ultimatum to
        Serbia, demanding among other things that Austrian officials be
        permitted to collaborate in investigating and punishing the
        perpetrators of the assassination.
      \item
        The Serbs counted on Russian support, even to the point of war,
        judging that Russia could not yield in a Balkan crisis, for the
        third time in six years, without losing its influence in the
        Balkans altogether.
      \item
        The Russians in turn counted on France; and France, terrified at
        the possibility of being some day caught alone in a war with
        Germany and determined to keep Russia as an ally at any cost, in
        effect gave a blank check to Russia.

        It has often been said that had the German government know as a
        positive fact that England would fight, the war might not have
        come. Hence the evasiveness of British policy is made a
        contributing cause of the war.

      Never had the European states maintained such huge armies in
      peacetime as at the be ginning of the twentieth century. One, two,

In a system of raison detan't, increase in tension and the formation of
alliances shifted the local minima from peace to global warfare.

analyzing individul actors in a broader system

While many individual actors could be blamed, analysis at this level is
not useful for understanding causation.

The assassination of Franz Ferdinand caused World War One. In 1914, a
Serbian member of the Black Hand ``assassinated the heir to the Hapsburg
empire.'' (citation). This murder caused the Austrian government to try
and end Serbia's independence; global warfare ensued. However, for the
assassination of Ferdinand to cause such a large scale event, larger
factors must have been at play. The situation was akin to an egg sitting
in a busy highway -- at some point, the egg will get cracked. Yes, the
driver who runs the egg over caused it to crack, but a deeper and more
useful understanding of causation comes from analyzing the situation
rather than the one of many possible drivers. At a higher level of
removal, it could be argued that Serbia was the cause of the war, as the
assassin was ``acting with the knowledge of certain Serbian
officials.''(citation). Or perhaps it was Austria, who issued a
``drastic ultimatum to Serbia.'' (citation). But Austria only did so
after Germany delivered ``their famous `blank check,' encourag{[}ing{]}
the Austrians to be firm.''(citation). Trying to determine which point
in this causational chain truly led to World War One is a fruitless
exercise, as the fact of the matter is, ``in the last years before 1914
the idea {[}was{]} that war was bound to break out sooner or later'' --
and this wasn't due to one meddling state (citation).

To better understand the cause of the war, we must first understand the
geopolitical situation at the time -- a time of growing alliances and
tensions. In 1817, the fear of warfare led Germany to form ``a military
alliance with Austria-Hungary, to which Italy was added in 1882.''
(citation).
