            <pre><code>For each of the scenarios below, answer the following questions. You do not have to explain your answers other than to explain where your targets would come from (Are they in the dataset already? Do you need to create them by hand?) and how you would make any non-numerical inputs numerical, if required by the algorithm you choose.

            1. What type of machine learning problem (regression, classification, clustering) do you think this is?
            2. If this is a supervised problem, what will you use as your targets (aka labels) and how will you get them? If this is an unsupervised problem, just write &quot;none&quot;.
            3. What processing do you need to do to your input data? (How will you handle non-numerical inputs? Do you plan to do any scaling? etc.)
            4. What type(s) of model(s) would you try? Remember to start with the simplest thing that might work! The types of models we&#39;ve talked about are linear regression, decision trees, random forest, logistic regression, naive bayes, K-means, DBSCAN, and fully connected neural networks.
            5. What validation metric(s) would you use to decide how well you&#39;re doing?
            6. What ethical challenges do the data collection, creation, and/or use of this model create? If you feel there aren’t any, just say “None”.


            Scenarios:

            1. You are playing fantasy football and want to predict how many points each player will score next season. You have their stats, including points scored, from last season, plus their height, weight, and position -- except for players new to the league, for whom you don&#39;t have last year&#39;s stats, only height, weight, and position.
            2. You have customer reviews, each one of which has a rating from 1 (worst) to 10 (best) and some text. The reviews vary greatly in their length. You would like to use this to write a model that can predict if text is positive, negative, or neutral, along with a probability score (e.g., 68% likely to be positive, 30% neutral, 2% negative).
            3. You have data from a movie streaming service that consists of lists of movies that each user has watched as well as information about each movie: title, names of the stars, genre, and length. You would like to make a model that will help you decide what movies to recommend to users.
            4. You want to predict whether a random stranger owns a cat, a dog, or neither, based on things that they like on Facebook. You decide to train your model on your friends, and write a program to collect all of their public Likes. 
            5. You want a model to predict the number of deer that will be born in a breeding season. You have a large amount of historical data, and each row consists of the following information for the breeding season of a particular area and species:
                    number of fawns born
                    the genus and species
                    number of does sighted during the mating season
                    vegetation quality during the mating season (&quot;low&quot;, &quot;average&quot;, or &quot;high&quot;)</code></pre>
