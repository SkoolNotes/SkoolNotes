            The political scientist Kenneth Waltz argues that the causes of war can be analyzed at three different levels: the individual human level, the state level, and the international system level. Those who view things from the first level believe that war is best explained by “selfishness,” “misdirected aggressive impulses,” or “stupidity” within the human psyche. Those who favor the second level believe there are hostile or aggressive or revisionist states who, because of their form of government or other domestic issues, behave in a warlike manner while other states simply want to keep the peace (the status quo). Those who favor the third level believe that the international system itself, because it is an anarchy with “no system of law enforceable” between states, and in which each state acts according to its own interest and reserves the right to use force to achieve its aims, makes war inevitable. 

              

            Analyze World War 1 according to one (or a blend) of these levels of analysis. Make an argument that combines an explanation of the general causes of the war with the specific sequence of events (including events that prolonged the war beyond the initial outbreak). I would suggest using a chronological organization to your essay.

            <p>levels of analysis:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>individual</p></li>
            <li><p>state</p></li>
            <li><p>systemic</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>example: put an egg in a highway, do you blame the car that chrushes it?</p>
            <p>how do we think about inevitability?</p>
            <p>relative usefullness of each one</p>
            <p>how do they intersect? system provides inevitability, but is that emergent out of the qualities of the individual?</p>
            <p>potential essay: top down, each one informs the next. simply map to analysis levels</p>
            <p>claim: not actully three seperate levels? higher up levels cannot be generated withought the previous?</p>
            <p>systems need to account for randomness, which is inevitable. thus, higher level analysis?</p>
            <p>the fact that ferdinand dying caused this meant that there was a higher level issue?</p>
            <p>systems: random chance events will happen</p>
            <p>was it a random chance event? was this the ‘natural progression of things’?</p>
            <p>or is the aproach, ‘random chance events are inevitable (in a system with so many actors), thus the system must be set up for this? or it is part of the system?’</p>
            <p>top down:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>because of this system, it was inevitable that a state would act out.</p></li>
            <li><p>lets look at this state. because of this state, it was inevitable that a person would act out</p></li>
            <li><p>lets look at that person</p></li>
            <li><p>discuss merits of different levels of analysis?</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>bottom up:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>this person did this, and that caused the war.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>usefullness of analysis at different levels?</p>
            <p>war is a local minima in the system</p>
            <p>nukes have allowed us to jump peaks and reach a lower minima</p>
            <p>warring state has incentive to bring allies into war</p>
            <p>non warring states have incentive to allie with winning side and gain power with them, as well as prevent others from becoming to powerful – BOP dynamic from resan detant</p>
            <p>this brings the entire system into war</p>
            <p>as more actors join into the war, you MUST join the war. one side of the war will win, and massively gain power. you cannot stay at your old divided power level.</p>
            <p>just as peace is an emergent property of raison detant (BOP), global war can be as well? easily “excitable”</p>
            <p>prisoners dillema sqaure, when tensions are high, best desition is to attack. also best descition to bring allies, and best desition for allies to join in. tragedy of the commons. war breaks out</p>
            <p>OLD: <span>[</span>aa<span>]</span> =&gt; 1,1. <span>[</span>da, ad<span>]</span> =&gt; 0,3 3,0. <span>[</span>dd<span>]</span> =&gt; 2,2. a NEW: <span>[</span>aa, ad, da<span>]</span> =&gt; 0,0. <span>[</span>dd<span>]</span> =&gt; 2,2. d</p>
            <p>system has changed, MAD has allowed us to jump peaks to a lower minima.</p>
            <p>war only breaks out when tenstions are high, otherwise you would just defend.</p>
            <p>once tensions become high, war becomes inevitable, and can be triggered at the smallest event.</p>
            <p>^^ goes in bp3</p>
            <p>franz ferdinand died, and that caused the war. if that could cause the war, something was up.</p>
            <p>germany caused the tenstions which caused the war. but {transition}</p>
            <p>system level game theory analysis</p>
            <p>thesis ideas:</p>
            <p>levels of analysis are usefull at the level you can impact? doesnt work if higher level informs your level of impact…</p>
            <p>causation is defined by what is usefull?</p>
            <p>potential outline:</p>
            <p>start with small explanatin: ferdinand and states but were they realy to blame? egg in street</p>
            <p>systemic explanation</p>
            <p>which requires tenstion</p>
            <p>thesis: tension changed the local minima to global warfare</p>
            <p>switch tenstion and system explanation?</p>
            <p>everyone had huge armies, and they all took it for granted that a war was coming even though few wanted one pg. 1-2</p>
            <p>“In the last years before 1914 the idea that war was bound to break out sooner or later probably made some statesmen, in some countries, more willing to unleash it.”is thiss cus “it would happen anyways” or cus “we want to be first”?</p>
            <p>formed the triple alliance out of fear that the german empire would be torn to peices in another european war</p>
            <p>french formed their own alliance in response</p>
            <p>britain and germany had a naval race</p>
            <p>germans felt encircled by france and russia alliance even more concerned when france joined them</p>

            <p>THESIS: In a system of raison detan’t, increase in tension shifted the local minima from peace to global warfare.</p>
