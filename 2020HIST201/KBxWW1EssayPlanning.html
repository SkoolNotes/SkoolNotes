            The political scientist Kenneth Waltz argues that the causes of war can be analyzed at three different levels: the individual human level, the state level, and the international system level. Those who view things from the first level believe that war is best explained by “selfishness,” “misdirected aggressive impulses,” or “stupidity” within the human psyche. Those who favor the second level believe there are hostile or aggressive or revisionist states who, because of their form of government or other domestic issues, behave in a warlike manner while other states simply want to keep the peace (the status quo). Those who favor the third level believe that the international system itself, because it is an anarchy with “no system of law enforceable” between states, and in which each state acts according to its own interest and reserves the right to use force to achieve its aims, makes war inevitable. 

              

            Analyze World War 1 according to one (or a blend) of these levels of analysis. Make an argument that combines an explanation of the general causes of the war with the specific sequence of events (including events that prolonged the war beyond the initial outbreak). I would suggest using a chronological organization to your essay.

            <p>non warring states have incentive to allie with winning side and gain power with them, as well as prevent others from becoming to powerful – BOP dynamic from resan detant</p>
            <p>this brings the entire system into war</p>
            <p>as more actors join into the war, you MUST join the war. one side of the war will win, and massively gain power. you cannot stay at your old divided power level.</p>
            <p>just as peace is an emergent property of raison detant (BOP), global war can be as well? easily “excitable”</p>
            <p>prisoners dillema sqaure, when tensions are high, best desition is to attack. also best descition to bring allies, and best desition for allies to join in. tragedy of the commons. war breaks out</p>

            <p>In a system of raison detan’t, increase in tension and the formation of alliances shifted the local minima from peace to global warfare.</p>
            <p>analyzing individul actors in a broader system</p>
            <p>While many individual actors could be blamed, analysis at this level is not useful for understanding causation.</p>
            <p>The assassination of Franz Ferdinand caused World War One. In 1914, a Serbian member of the Black Hand “assassinated the heir to the Hapsburg empire.” (citation). This murder caused the Austrian government to try and end Serbia’s independence; global warfare ensued. However, for the assassination of Ferdinand to cause such a large scale event, larger factors must have been at play. The situation was akin to an egg sitting in a busy highway – at some point, the egg will get cracked. Yes, the driver who runs the egg over caused it to crack, but a deeper and more useful understanding of causation comes from analyzing the situation rather than the one of many possible drivers. At a higher level of removal, it could be argued that Serbia was the cause of the war, as the assassin was “acting with the knowledge of certain Serbian officials.”(citation). Or perhaps it was Austria, who issued a “drastic ultimatum to Serbia.” (citation). But Austria only did so after Germany delivered “their famous ‘blank check,’ encourag<span>[</span>ing<span>]</span> the Austrians to be firm.”(citation). Trying to determine which point in this causational chain truly led to World War One is a fruitless exercise, as the fact of the matter is, “in the last years before 1914 the idea <span>[</span>was<span>]</span> that war was bound to break out sooner or later” – and this wasn’t due to one meddling state (citation).</p>
            <p>To better understand the cause of the war, we must first understand the geopolitical situation at the time – a time of growing alliances and tensions. In 1817, the fear of warfare led Germany to form “a military alliance with Austria-Hungary, to which Italy was added in 1882.” (citation). This alliance led to the creation of another; faced by this new threat, France allied with Russia, and later, England. Tension only grew, as Germany “who already felt encircled by the alliance of France and Russia, naturally watched with concern the drift of England into the Franco-Russian camp.”(citation). The Continental Great Powers were now riddled with alliances. These alliances contributed to the massive amount of tension, evident by the “huge standing army” and “millions of trained reserves among the civilian population” of each Continental Great Power. (citation). This tension created a feeling of impending war, “in which allies would be necessary.” (citation). This feeling tightened existing alliances and led to the creation of new ones, in turn contributing to even greater tension. Alliances formed, tension grew, and the with this change the local minima began to shift. { could mention: Massive industrial and economic growth }</p>
            <p>The emergent property from raison d’etat changes from a balance of power to large scale conflict when alliances and tension are introduced. A system of states all enacting raison d’etat is known to lead to a balance of power, as when any one state gains power, the others act in their own best interest and crush the rising state. Out of pure self interest arises peace. We can represent this scenario with a payoff matrix – two actors, each with two possible actions: attack or defend. If both states defend, they each get a score of two. If both attack, they each lose resources, and any power gained would be crushed; each state gets a zero. If one state attacks while the other defends, the same scenario occurs. In this case, defending is clearly the best action. However, as alliances form, this payoff matrix changes. If an alliance attacks, it becomes much more likely that they will reap a reward, as crushing them requires an alliance of equal or greater size. If one doesn’t form, the alliance gets a score of three, and the defending party a zero. Thus, larger alliances form as a preemptive measure. For any insider – an attacking or defending party – the best course of action would be to try and recruit more allies. One side is expected to win, and effectively gain the power of their fallen foes. And hence, outsiders, if the war is sufficiently large, must join the fray lest they be left in the dust with their old divided power level.</p>

            <li><p>we can represent this scenario with a payoff matrix, with two actors who can either defend or attack</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>if both actors defend, they get a reward, say two.</p></li>
            <li><p>if both actors attack, any resulting power gained would just be crushed by the state system, so each state would get 0 or lower.</p></li>
            <li><p>if one actor attacks and another defends, then any resulting power would againbe chrushed, resulting in 0.</p></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><p>the best option is clearly to defend.</p></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><p>when large allainces form, it becomes a lot more likely that the AD scenario results in a reward, 0,3.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>if the balance of power system is to be preserved, allainces of greater size must be formed (temp?)</p></li>

            <li><p>Unsure of whether or not attacking will be fruitfull. With tension, you want to attack first.</p></li>
