            <ul>
            <li><p>Considered the British as a lowly subject and dismissed their claims to increase trade and communication</p></li>
            <li><p>Created a high trade deficit through the oblivious to trade through Confucian philosophy</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="the-opium-wars">The Opium Wars</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><p>The British used opium as compensation for the trade deficit between Britian=&gt;China and China=&gt;Britian</p></li>
            <li><p>When Chinese officials began controlling the trade of opionum, it was both to late and also was handled with mixed results due to difference in opionion.</p></li>
            <li><p>When sudden enforcement of trade occured, the British felt like it was an insult to the British crown and proceeded to wage war against the navally-weak China.</p></li>
            <li><p>After loosing the opionum war, the Qing court had to agree to a series of supplicating agreements that ended with hurtful consiquences and CLAIM without realizing destroyed the foreign policies of China.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="beginnings-of-unrest">Beginnings of Unrest</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><p>The Taiping Movement</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>Taiping movement threatened the Qing government’s (a.k.a. British) trading of opium, but supported the spead of Christianity (albeit the flavor where the emperor is Jesus’ yonger brother.)</p></li>
            <li><p>Power struggle in the Taiping regieme lead to internal collapse a few years later.</p></li>
            <li><p>Manchu weakness forced them to give the Chinese-Chinese army more power to quell the movement</p></li>
            </ul></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>In 1858, Anglo-French forces invaded Beijing, storming the summer palace, took over the Chinese tax system, and eventually basically established the Qing rule as a colony of the west.</strong></p>
            <p>Kidnapped Chinese people to serve as indentured servants in the west. Confusion officials called for “self-strengthening”, usually to little results due to the argricultural-dependent Qing state. The empress dowager’s mismanagement of funds are CLAIM a symptom of the Qing court weakness. The Chinese sussession of Taiwan to Japan lead the Western nations to fear for the collapse of the profitable Qing dynasty; in turn, the “Scramble for consessions” occured where contries fervantly attempted to establish special trading licenses. The uninvolved US issued “open door notes” to all contries, calling on opening China as a free trade zone. Kang Youwei urged the emperor to issue many edicts of westernization, but was quickly crushed by the empress dowager cixi. Conservatives seized the control of the Qing court, which resulted in more anger and mutiny throughout the country (but, interestingly, against western regions.) The Boxer rebellion urged the whole country to dispose of any foreigners there may be for they believed that the foreigners were the root of Qing dynasty’s problems. The empress eventually suported their decision, causing the 8-nation army to invade and her to fleed to the countryside. After this, the e.d. decided to support westernization. Urge for the adoption of constitutional monarchy created centers of opposition to the Qing imperial system. Sun Zhongshan, after being found out to promote the overthrowing of the Chinese governement, fled to Japan and established his concept of revolution. Qiu Jin — a woman revolutionary who studied in Japan and went back to China for the revolutionary cause. She was later executed for treasion.</p>
