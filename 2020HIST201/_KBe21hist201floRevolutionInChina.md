## warlord cliques

### dominated chinese politics for next 3 decades

### most powerful clique was in north china headed by Yuan Shikai

### Shanghai and Canton made second power center, favored politicians like Sun Yat-sen

## university students, teachers, and intellectuals

### played critical roles in civilization but were defenseless in force

## secret societies

### envisioned restoration of monarchical rule under a Chinese dynasty

## western power intervention and japan

### wanted to capitalize on power vacuum

### japan from mid-1890s to 1945 (end of WWI)

# may fourth movement

## Sun Yat-sen headed Revolutionary Alliance---loose combo of anti-Qing political groups that started the 1911 revolt

## claimed mandate of heaven but warlords had true power

## set up a Parliament and elected cabinets but had minimal actual effect

## Sun Yat-sen resigned in favor of Yuan Shikai in 1912 (northern warlord)

### Yuan Shikai pretended to be democratic but built up military

### few years later, used military and assassinations to remove opposition

## Japan and WWI

### japan took german concessions in China after WWI

### gave Yuan the 21 demands in early 1915, which would reduce china to a \'dependant protectorate\'

### Yuan was indecisive and instead rallied support for himself instead of responding

1.  a rival warlord took his support by being hostile to japan and Yuan
    resigned in 1916

### after the war (1919), japan won german concessions

1.  this made the students upset -\> protests and mass boycotts

## democracy and individualism popular in urban youth

### democratic thinkers toured china

### novel by Ba Jin depicts boy ignoring arranged marriage

### however, elections and stuff didnt work because warlords were in control

1.  so they decided more radical action was needed

## Bolshevik victory in Russia

### chinese seriosuly considered marxism

### Li Dazhao decided to interpret marxism for china\'s situation

1.  he saw the pheasants as the vanguard of urban change

### all chinese as proletarian, and bourgeois was the industrialized West (unification)

## marxist study club (including Mao Zedong)

### also believed in authoritarian state that intervened helpfully in many aspects of life

## summer of 1921

### a handful of marxist leaders from different parts of China met secretly in Shanghai

### Communist party of China born

### few supporters but provided new ideology over confucianism

# Seizure of Power by the Guomindang (nationalist party, Sun Yat-sen)

## promised international and domestic change, but only implemented international change

### pushed foreigners out but didnt implement land reform which is what the pheasants cared about

## slowly forged alliances with \'key social groups\' and built an army in south of china

## nationalists used communists as major link to peasants and urban workers

## also asked soviets for help

## soviet military academy

### first headed by Chiang Kai-shek who didnt like the communists

### but he had to wait for the army to be trained

## after Sun yat-sen dies in 1925, Chaing kai-shek captures and bribes warlords

### becomes the head of a warlord hierarchy, essentially controlling china

# mao and the peasant option

## mao background

### father was a prosperous peasant, but mao rebelled early

### believed revolution was violent and peasants needed to use force to overthrow landlords

## after Chaing seized control, he massacared communists in Shanghai in 1927

## a later attack to communists in south central china caused Mao to spearhead a long march

### 90k followers in 1934, thousands of miles to the more remote northwest

### created a new communist center

## long march solidified Mao\'s leadership of the Chinese communist party, but japanese eroded Chaing\'s power structure

# global great depression

## a decade after WWI, caused many international crises

## caused by problems in economic systems and reliance on cheap raw goods

## causation

### food overproduction drove down prices

1.  high prices during the war led to overconfident loans

2.  runaway spiral of loans from the US to european countries + postwar
    inflation?

3.  optimized exploitation of colonies to produce coffee sugar rubber
    production worsened the same cycle

### poor leadership

1.  leaders were interested in their own debts being paid than
    facilitating balanced econ growth

2.  protectionism reduced market opportunities and made it worse

## the formal advent of the Depression (October 1929)

### us stock market crash brings everything down

1.  bc the US gave out so many loans

2.  people trying to cut losses made things worse

3.  thus lower production levels and rising unemployment

4.  reinforcing cycle from 1929 to 1933, even France and Italy drawn
    into vortex by 1931

## comparison

### first great depression of the industrial age
