# Impacts of the Industrial Revolution
@Kennnedy [[KBhHIST201MasonAndKennedy]]

## Impact on Warfare
See [[KBhHIST201IRonWarfare]]

## Impact on Finances
**IR Brought the Enlargement of the financial sector**

* National + international banking increased
* Regimes could raise funds much easier


*  Britain ticked so much boxes that worked out to become one that stands out form the rest
*  CLAIM post-1860 industrialization will change world balance again

<!--
* Data helps us determine the degree of change that actually occurs
	* However, this is a flawed system for smaller democracies => economic wealth did not translate into military power
	* Statistics are usually calculated afterwards, anyways
-->

## Impact on Life
1) Increase in population
2) Worsened average living conditions

The IR sent the **world population to go up** very high but was able to sustain itself because the product of technology and the technology acquired allowed population and sustenance of population to grow alongside each other â€” keeping both in check, so boo Malthus.

* Economic size, productivity, and purchasing power increased far more than the actual population
* "In Queen Victoria's reign alone, product per capita rose two and a half times."
		
**Living conditions, however, is terrible**: the "proletariat" as a social class began existing => lived in "unhealthy, crowed, jerry-built cities". But, CLAIM, this was overall a good thing b/c in dramatically increased production with little to the actual cost.
