            <p>Three aspects: embracing Industrialization-tech based military warfare that originated in Europe; promoting free trade and market economy; organizing states under civic top-down nationalism.</p>
            <h3 id="modern-warfare">Modern Warfare</h3>
            <p>England, through utilizing <span>[</span><span>[</span>KBhHIST201IRonWarfare<span>]</span><span>]</span>, was able to gather a huge competitive advantage over other nations.</p>
            <p>BC — new tech made military much better. They did two things: they made the navy much more economically and physically efficient but also just made them good ol’ fashioned <em>better</em>.</p>
            <p>Per the BA, the British royal navy was actually able to have a huge boost in fighting power even while reducing its count during the 1810s.</p>
            <p>Such efficiencies is unrivaled even compared to the traditionally large nations. By embracing the <span>[</span><span>[</span>KBhHIST201IndustrialRevolution<span>]</span><span>]</span>, new conquirings are possible that would not have been possible before. BD against traditionally large nations that simply did not had the speed to embrace and master <span>[</span><span>[</span>KBhHIST201IRonWarfare<span>]</span><span>]</span>.</p>
            <h3 id="free-trade-and-private-production">Free Trade and Private Production</h3>
            <p>After the BF Great War caused a disruptions of trade, European nations started to use and embrace free trade. BE.</p>
            <p>In addition to its seapower, British domination could also be attributed to that of free trade. CA. European nations actively urged the process of free trade, even setting up colonies (DA) for the basic avoidance of interruption to free trade.</p>
            <p>Sidenote, they also actively weaponized free trade a la opium war. =&gt; they were to willing back up and support free trade with their stronger army.</p>
            <p>(Colonization is more mercantilist; so instead, talk about trade that is aligned with industrial needs. “what aspects of European trade was more successful?”)</p>
            <p>If a country does not follow the operations of free trade, they are very sad. See: the Ottomans + Defensive Developmentalism.</p>
            <p>The principles of DD encouraged the creation of more centralized control of both military power and economy based on an anti-european sentiment. So, the Ottoms tried to EA — back away from trade. That was a bad idea: EB — their centralized control failed and they evenually turned back to relying on the free market + private production.</p>
            <h3 id="kbhhist201nationalism-namely-civic-nationalism"><span>[</span><span>[</span>KBhHIST201Nationalism<span>]</span><span>]</span>, namely Civic Nationalism</h3>
            <p>Powerful Nation-States were created by nationalism. FD</p>
            <p><span>[</span><span>[</span>KBhHIST201GermanicNationalism<span>]</span><span>]</span> worked! FA — countries like Italy and Germany supported the efforts of Nationalism.</p>
            <p>Although not strictly a nationalist speech, FB — Iron and Blood — showed clear nationalist sentiments. he executed FC — forceful actions — that ensured the unification of Germany by consolidating Prussian power with those nearby: rallying under the image of Germanic civic nationalism.</p>
            <p>When a country does not do nationalism, it does not go well.</p>
            <p>Either…</p>
            <ol>
            <li><p>A country tries to enforce dynastarial control over disperate regions instead of an identity centered around nationalism, things go wrong. FE — <em>seperatism</em> is engendered, which does not promote the national identity definition to national ideals w/ common culture. This is party how the Ottomans went.</p></li>
            <li><p>A country tries to give up control and have weaker, local governance. This means that important national efforts like in China’s case for westernization GA could have much lesser effect than if there were to be a stronger central government with shared <strong>ideals</strong>, which would safeguard against GB Cixi-style trading favourites and politiking</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>**For a nation-state to achieve global success and dominance in the 19th century, they must leverage the forces of industrial modernization — bringing increased fighting power of an industrialized modern military, the economic benefits of transitioning from mercantilism to free trade and market economy, and the centralized political control offered by top-down civic nationalism."</p>
