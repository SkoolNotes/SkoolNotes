\begin{quote}
Option 1: "The concept of the balance of power was simply an extension
of conventional wisdom. Its primary goal was to prevent domination by
one state and to preserve the international order; it was not designed
to prevent conflicts, but to limit them. To the hard-headed statesmen of
the eighteenth century, the elimination of conflict (or of ambition or
of greed) was utopian; the solution was to harness or counterpoise the
inherent flaws of human nature to produce the best possible long-term
outcome."

Henry Kissinger, Diplomacy

From one point of view, balance of power politics in the early modern
period succeeded spectacularly, preventing a single European power from
conquering the whole continent, although Napoleon almost succeeded. From
another point of view, it exported great power conflict to the rest of
the world, turning Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and the Americas into
battlegrounds for rivalling European states. In the end, did the
European balance of power succeed in its goal to, as Kissinger puts it,
limit conflict and produce the ``best possible outcome'' from flawed
human nature? Or did it magnify conflict and increase the likelihood of
global war? Answer this question in a well organized essay using
examples from multiple global regions. (Kissinger, Mason, Roberts)

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Raison d'etat

  In the 16th century, as the Reformations saw the church lose its
  political standing over Europe, the emerging states of Europe needed
  some philosophy to balance power amongst them and prevent unification,
  which they imagined to require innevitable and brutal conflict. The
  statesmen of the time, following the example of Cardinal de Richelieu,
  First minister of France from 1624 to 1642 (Kissinger 58), settled on
  the policy of \emph{Raison d'etat}: the idea that a group of states
  each pursuing its own selfish interests would create a balance of
  power, with weaker states banding together in times of need and no one
  state gaining a significant upper hand.
\item
  Mercantalism

  At roughly the same time, the concept of mercantalism, or the idea
  that economic transactions are zero sum games that the government must
  control and play, cropped up. Proponents such as Jean-Baptiste
  Colbert, minister of finance and minister of marine and colonies for
  France from 1661 to 1683, saw mercantalism as a component of Raison
  d'etat's \textless punctuation, apostrophe?\textgreater{} selfish
  furthering of the state. While Raison d'etat primarily concerned
  negotiations with and attitudes towards neighboring states,
  mercantalism had colonial implications. This dual philosophy of
  looking to gain the upper hand both militarily and economically,
  termed "balance of power politics" was supposed to keep peace and
  limit conflict in Europe. However, it ultamately magnified conflict
  both on the European subcontinent and in various colonial endevours.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{thesis}{%

Although Europe managed to remain disjoint and disunited, conflict based
politics and the related mecentalist mindset hardly limited conflict or
produced a desireable \textless WC\textgreater{} outcome: Raison d'etat
is a viscious cycle that prolonged wars in Europe, exported conflict and
oppression to India and the Caribbean, and forces itself upon
territories it encounters.

Raison d'etat--the basis \textless WC\textgreater{} for 'balance of

suffering, creating unessesary conflict for a not-so-rosy
\textless WC\textgreater{} continuation of power struggle
\textless rephrase\textgreater{} that other states could respond only
with their own selfish strategies \textless phrasing\textgreater. When
Richelieu came to power in 1624, France was surrounded by Habsburg lands
and the Holy Roman Empire still posed a military threat. However, when
the Holy Roman Emperor refused peace terms with the Protestant princes
on religious grounds, Richelieu was determined to take advantage of the
fighting (Kissinger 61). As Henery Kissinger, American politician and
diplomat explained in \emph{Diplomacy}, "In order to prolong the war and
exhaust the belligrants, Richelieu subsidized the enemeies of his
enemies, bribed, {[}and{]} formented insurrections," (Kissinger 62)

By defenestrating \textless wc: too memey?\textgreater{} morality and
focusing on political interests, Richelieu chose to protect France in
the international game of prisoners dilemma \textless phrasing: game? of
prisoner's dilemma\textgreater. Richelieu continued to act exclusively
in the interest of the state, standing by while Germany was devastated
and fighting on the side of the Protestant princes with to exploit
France's growing power (Kissinger 62).

By taking advantage of existing conflict, letting Europe bleed until it
was time to extract, France expanded its power until it could not be
ignored. The balance of power that Richelieu expected could only come
when neighbooring states banded together to stop a stroger power from
taking over, with each state constantly reassessing its relationships
with its neighbors. In other words, as soon as one state adopts Raison
d'etat, all the neighboring states must do so as well or risk being
crushed by the aggressor. In this way, Raison d'etat not only promotes
war and death, it also proliferates by forcing the hand of others. In
essence, Raison d'etat exploits the tragedy of the commons and create
hostility between all parties--seeking a fragile balance of power built
on conflict and shifting loyalties. \textless TODO: summarize, maybe a

Not only did "conflict politics" \textless WC\textgreater{} prolong
\textless WC\textgreater{} conflict \textless WC\textgreater{} in
Europe, it also created an air of rivalary that brought other reigons,
such as India, into the fray. Because Raison d'etat only creates a

territories can lead only to conflict and domination.

The colonial domination of India began with fortified trading posts
owned by the French and British East Indian companies. As the rivalary
between the British and French grew, their respcetive merchant companies
were subliminally pressured to be more aggressive, turn more profit, and
generally outpace the counterpart. When the opportunity to expand their
respective operations arose, the trading companies began fighting
battles, negotiating terms, and ruling large swaths of land in India.
The British gained a solid foothold in 1757 when the British East India
Company army defeated the Mughal governer of Bengal at Plassey in 1757
(Trauttman 176). It was in this way that the profit incentivised
companies became, as American historian Thomas Trauttmann put it,
"war-making entities" that "drew Indian governments into the commercial
and national struggle between the British and the French" (Trauttmann
176).

As the British tightend it's grasp on India and drove the French out, it
further assimilated the native power structure and peoples into it's
military \textless rephrase\textgreater. The mercentalist ambitions of
the company strove to extract profit from each interaction, failing to
keep its soldiers happy. The mutanies that resulted, especially in 1806
and 1857, were sparked by the feeling that religion was under attack
(Trauttmann 179). As the rebellion spread, the British struggled to
quell the conflict that resulted from the mercantalist inspired,
extraction oriented approach to rule.

After the rebellion was extinguished, the Company used the remaining
loyal troops to further repress the uprising, with some mutineers being
tied to the ends of cannons and blown in half (Trauttmann 181). The
mercantilist mindset and French rivalary drove the British to maximize
extraction of value from India, repressing the people and creating
conflict along the way. Raison d'etat was meant to limit conflict and
prevent the inhumane domination of a territory by a single power, yet
the British did exactly that to India in the process. Because India saw
it's trade relation with Europe as a positive sum game instead of
through the mercantalist lense, and because it did not participate in
Raison d'etat, it was trampled by the states vying for power and
suffered as a result. This serves as an example of how Raison d'etat
brings down a healthy relationship and enforces conflict: an aggressive
state forces others to fight it, or risk destruction themselves. Thus,
Raison d'etat and mercantalism only achieves a balance of power by
incentivising conflict and threatening destruction.

\subsection{Caribbean}\label{caribbean}}

Like India, colonial rivalaries brought European exploitation and
conflict to the Caribbean, wiped out the native population, created
demand for slaves, and brought more profit seeking Europeans to continue
the cycle.

When the Spanish established colonies on the larger Caribbean islands,
they were only there to gain some slight imperial advantages over their
enemies back in Europe. As in India, the native inhabitants of the
Caribbean were unable to resist the weapons and disease brought be the
Europeans, and were subsequently trampled by the ambitions of Raison
d'etat and the mercantalist agenda. However, the promise of new lands
and rivalry between nations took the exploitation of the Caribbean
multiple steps further. As British Historian J. M. Roberts explains,
"The spanish occupation of the larger Caribbean islands \ldots{}
attracted the attention of the English, French, and Dutch" (Roberts
650).

\hypertarget{the-spanish-occupation-of-the-larger-caribbean-islands-attracted-the-attention-of-the-english-french-and-dutch-roberts-650}{%

(Roberts
650)}\label{the-spanish-occupation-of-the-larger-caribbean-islands-attracted-the-attention-of-the-english-french-and-dutch-roberts-650}}

The selfish hunger for power endorsed by Raison d'etat brought the first
Europeans to the Caribbean, and the fear of domination by those early
settlers brought the rest of the Europeans too. Once settled, the
mercantalist mindset and rivalary of European nations brought the
backstabbing conflict to everyday Caribbean life. In fact, England's new
tobacco colonies became of great importance not only because of the
revenue that the mercantalist mindset so sought, but also because the
"provided fresh opportunities for interloping in the trade of the
Spanish empire" (Roberts 651).

\hypertarget{tobacco-colonies-in-the-new-world-rapidly-became-of-great-importance-to-england-not-only-because-of-the-customs-revenue-they-supplied-but-also-because-they-provided-fresh-opportunities-for-interloping-in-the-trade-of-the-spanish-empire.-roberts-651}{%

The Europeans stayed and expanded their exploitative opperation in the
Caribbean because mercantalist dictated that they had to extract as much
profit as possible, and because Raison d'etat feared that others would
take advantage if they did not.

\hypertarget{production-was-for-a-long-time-held-back-by-a-shortage-of-labor-as-the-native-populations-of-the-islands-succumbed-to-european-ill-treatment-and-disease.-roberts-650}{%

Even when the original capacity for profit of the islands were
saturated, the mercantalist mindset demanded more production. Instead of
resting after wiping out the natives and turning a new land into a
production factory, the default mindset focused on ever more profit.
Roberts summarizes "production was for a long time held back by a
shortage of labor, as the native populations of the islands succumed to
European ill-treatment and disease." (Roberts 650) Raison d'etat was not
satisfied with taking over a foreign land and decimamating the
population--the focus of the sentiment was always to increase
production--and if the natives died to the Europeans then the Europeans
would have to import a new workforce to abuse from elsewhere. The common
thread through this intercontinental exploitation is the Raison d'etat
induced rivalary between the states of Europe and the profit hungry
mercantalist mindset that saw no limits. The Spanish landed in the
Caribbean to extract profit from new lands. Other European states
arrived to conflict the Spanish and balance out power. The European
states stayed in fear of other states taking advantage of the situation,
and they brought slaves in to out-produce their European rivals.
Ironically, Raison d'etat was meant to strike a balance of power and
prevent domination of a single power, yet India and the Caribbean were
both trampled and suffered the ill effects of domination. The power
struggle created by Raison d'etat sucked the Caribbean into the
conflict, and after destroying the native population, the European
countries were still locked in the viscious cycle of Raison d'etat.

In Europe, states exercising balance of power politics caused states to

cynical \textless WC beligrant? not benevolent\textgreater{}
international relations of states practicing Raison d'etat also forced
the aggressive attitude upon surrounding states, as those who didn't
fight back would be trampled. This rivalary not only consumed Europe but
also spilled over into the various overseas colonies of its states,

While the original supporters of balance of power politics may have seen

intact, conflict was ultamately magnified both within Europe and in the
rest of the world.
