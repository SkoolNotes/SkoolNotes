\begin{quote}
The political scientist Kenneth Waltz argues that the causes of war can
be analyzed at three different levels: the individual human level, the
state level, and the international system level. Those who view things
from the first level believe that war is best explained by
``selfishness,'' ``misdirected aggressive impulses,'' or ``stupidity''
within the human psyche.

Those who favor the second level believe there are hostile or aggressive
or revisionist states who, because of their form of government or other
domestic issues, behave in a warlike manner while other states simply
want to keep the peace (the status quo).

Those who favor the third level believe that the international system
itself, because it is an anarchy with ``no system of law enforceable''
between states, and in which each state acts according to its own
interest and reserves the right to use force to achieve its aims, makes
war inevitable.

Analyze World War 1 according to one (or a blend) of these levels of
analysis. Which best explains the general causes of the war as well as
the specific sequence of events (\textbf{including events that prolonged
the war beyond the initial outbreak})?

At the turn of the twentieth century, Europe was locked in an arms race

grew, religious and cultural strifes inevitably intensified and
ultimately sparked the war.

Although a lack of enforcement of international order and ballooning

Reinforcing international incentives such as the security dilemma and

\hypertarget{industrialization---bigger-militaries}{%
\subsubsection{industrialization -\textgreater{} bigger
militaries}\label{industrialization---bigger-militaries}}

As a united Germany industrialized, both its population and industrial
might grew to rival the French and British powers of the time. For
instance, in 1880--nine years after Germany was officially unified--the
German empire produced only 8.5\% of the world's manufacturing output
while Britain produce 22.9\% of it. By 1913, deep into the security
dilemma and one year before the war, Germany had surpassed British
production and nearly doubled that of France's (Kennedy, Table 18).

Contries tend to grow their military as they industrialize, if only for
defensive purposes. As Germany doubled it's military population over
three decades to challenge century-long British and French domination,
nearby countries grew wary. As surpassed power and a failing empire,
France and Russia grew wary of the newfound power between them. They
allied with Britain in 1904 and 1907 respectively for fear of a coming
war.

\hypertarget{the-security-dilemma}{%
\subsubsection{the security dilemma}\label{the-security-dilemma}}

As countries formed aliances and grew their militaries, opposing parties
were forced to keep up in the arms race. This so called "security
dilemma" doubled the number of military and navel personel worldwide in
the 30 years between the German unification and the war, and nearly
tripled the global warship tonnage (Kennedy, Table 19-20). A level two
perspcetive would explain this aggression with Germany's expansionistic
ideals, but even Britain's liberal parliamentary democracy quadrupled
it's naval tonnage.

\hypertarget{cult-of-the-offensive}{%
\subsubsection{cult of the offensive}\label{cult-of-the-offensive}}

Leaders at the time believed that preempting war would allow a fast and
decisive victory. Even simplifying the outcomes to two countries and
four possibilites, where each country either attacks or defends, greedy
actors will choose to preempt war. As a result, each country prepared to
invade it's neighboors, and European tensions grew.

\hypertarget{mutually-assured-destruction}{%
\subsubsection{mutually assured
destruction}\label{mutually-assured-destruction}}

In fact, had a there been an international disencentive such as Mutually
Assured Destruction, the relative ordering of possibilites and therefore
the cost matrix would've prevented all out war between such parties. For
example, in a nuclear scenerio where any attacked country can retaliate
with their own warheads, the utility of each scenerio would be ordered
as follows:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
Utility & Our Actions & Their Actions \\
\midrule
\endhead
4 & Defend & Defend \\
3 & Attack & Defend \\
2 & Attack & Attack \\
1 & Defend & Attack \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

And in a two party system,

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
Top,Left & Attack & Defend \\
\midrule
\endhead
Attack & 2, 2 & 1, 3 \\
Defend & 3, 1 & 4, 4 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Although it may seem less risky for any given party to attack, the
utility of both defend increases as weapons get stronger until both
parties opt for a defense strategy under MAD. Modern mutually assured
destruction has so far prevented all out war, and a lack of such
disincentives made war more likely in the early 1900s.

As a side effect of this global militarization, the populous glorified
and anticipated war. This level three influence on the level one psyche
inflamed nationalist ideals across Europe and primed a now-ticking
explosive.

Popular works from the years leading up to the war describe how natural
and necessary war is. For instance, German general and influential
military writer Friedrich von Bernhardi (1849-1930) wrote in
\emph{Germany and the Next War} (1911) that "War is a biological
necessity of the first importance," and "The right of conquest is
universally acknowledged." (CITE) As both a high-ranking general and a
best-selling author, Bernhardi was in a unique position to influence the
public opinion about war. His aggressive stance is not surprising given
his military background, and his work was instrumental to priming
Germany for battle. A nation cannot go to war without the support of the
populous, as the citizens at large provide the troops, taxes, and labor
to sustain warfare. Such vehement arguments swayed public opinion and
opened the possibility of large-scale battle.

A level two viewpoint may counter that Germany was naturally
expansionist, but similar widespread sentiment in France suggests
government structure and ideology were not a sufficient influence on
public opinion. French writer Ronald Dorgeles (1885-1973) recalls the
mood in Paris at the outbreak of war, writing "Suddenly a heroic wind
lifted their heads. What? War, was it? Well then, let's go!" (CITE) The
French parliamentary constitutional government had been weakened by
civil unrest and would hardly have been able to force a uncooperative
populous to war, but even the left-wing activists agreed in August of
1914 to refrain from calling strikes during the duration of the war in
the Union Sacrée or Sacred Union. (CITE needed? :question:
\url{https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/026569147800800402?journalCode=ehqa})
Thus, French actions could not have been primarily governmental
influence, and such countries went to war due to level three influences
on public opinion.

An exclusively level one viewpoint may counter that German writers like
Heinrich von Treitschke had been espousing and glorifying war decades
before the rapid German industrialization beginning in 1970. However,
the shift was more recent in other countries. For instance, Dorgeles
notes the ideological one-eighty that socialist workers take upon
hearing of war. "seeing their old dreams of peace crumble, {[}socialism
workers{]} would stream out into the boulevards \ldots{} {[}but{]} they
would cry 'To Berlin!,' not 'Down with war!'" (CITE) Although Germany's
actions may be a result of it's level two structure, the level three
influence on level one psyche is required to explain the actions of
other states.

As countries militarized and nationalist views grew, would ethnic and
religious divisions intensify until something inevitably sparked war. In
the case of WWI, the weakest link was the religious divide in
Austria-Hungary. Over the course of a number of "Balkan crises," the
Eastern Orthodox Serbs and Bosnians in southern Austria-Hungary grew
discontent with the Roman Catholic Dual Monarchy that ruled the Habsburg
empire--soon to be Austria-Hungary. As the Ottoman empire declined, the
Serbs marked Bosnia as their own and were infuriated when Austria
annexed Bosnia in 1908. When a the Balkan wars saw Austria cut Serbia
off from the sea, Serbs both independent and Austrian grew exasperated
and desperate. (Reader page 6 CITE) This chain of events was driven by
recent level three influences: the ongoing security-dilemma-induced arms
race had Germany's neighbors scrambling for land and power. States and
citizens alike were expecting war, and looking to gain as much of an
upper hand as possible before it broke out.

As power dynamics shifted around the turn of the twentieth century, the
defined scarcity of state goals--such as the British ambition of having
the largest navy--set off a chain of events that led ultimately and
innevitably to global war. Without a change of level three incentives,
such as a global mediator or mutually assured destruction, shifting
power dynamics and the cult of the offensive will lead inescapably to
security-dilemma-induced arms race and growing tensions which cause
nationalist viewponts and breed rash individuals. Thus, international
disincentives like mutually assured destruction are key to keeping
political and economic incentives from inflaming ideological divides and
causing warfare.
