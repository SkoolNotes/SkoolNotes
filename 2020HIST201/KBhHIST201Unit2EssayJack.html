            <p> In the end, did the European balance of power succeed in its goal to, as Kissinger puts it, limit conflict and produce the “best possible outcome” from flawed human nature? Or did it magnify conflict and increase the likelihood of global war?</p>
            <p>## Quotable Quotes * Kissinger * “If the circumstances were reversed, we could equally be pro-German and anti-French.” A1 * “William was perfectly willing to negotiate with Louis XIV when he felt the balance of power could best be served by doing so.” A2 * “Agreeing on the importance of the balance of power did not, however, still British disputes about the best strategy to implement the policy. … The Whigs argued that GB should engage only when balance threatened, and only long enough to remove threat; Tories argued that GB’s duty was to <em>shape</em> the balance of power.” A3 * CLAIM: “Of course, in the end a balance of power always comes about de facto when several states interact.” A4 * “Power is too difficult to assess, and the willingness to vindicate it too various, to permit treating it as a reliable guide to international order. … The balance of power inhibits the capacity to overthrow the international order” A5 * “Every king consoled himself with the thought that strengthening his own rule was the greatest possible contribution to the general peace, and left it to the ubiquitous invisible hand to justify his exertions - without limiting his ambitions.” A6 * “But Louis XN gained no peace. of mind from security; he saw in it an opportunity for conquest. In his overzealous pursuit of raison d’etat, LouisXN alarmed the rest of Europe and brought together an anti-French coalition which, in the end, thwarted his design.” A7 * “Thereby, France lost the advantage of having adversaries constrained by moral considerations … Once all states played by the same rules, gains became much more difficult to achieve” A8 * Roberts * “In the next four centuries, Christianity was often to have disastrous effects. Confident in the possession of the true religion, Europeans were impatient and contemptuous of the values and achievements of the peoples and civilizations they disturbed.” A9 * “Greed quickly led to the abuse of power, to domination and exploitation by force. In the end this led to great crimes - though they were often committed unconsciously.” A10 * “Europeans could usually exact what they wanted in the end because of a technical superiority which exaggerated the power of their tiny numbers and for a few centuries turned the balance against the great historic agglomerations of population and civilization.” A11 * “The obscuring of the Company’s primary commercial role was not good for business. It also gave its employees even greater opportunities to feather their own nests. … the British government hoped as fervently as the Company to avoid being dragged any further into the role of imperial power in India.” A12 * “The huge and growing Caribbean market for slaves and imported European goods was added to that already offered by a Spanish empire increasingly unable to defend its economic monopoly. This fixed the role of the West Indies in the relationships of the European powers for the next century. … They were long a prey to disorder” A13 * “Gradually, the great powers fought out their disputes until they arrived at acceptable agreements, but this was to take a long time.” A14 * “All the colonial powers had, by the eighteenth century, been able to extract some economic profit from their colonies” A15 * “Europeans did not just conquer; they exterminated local cultures and peoples and replaced them with their own” A16 * “Older cultures were to be cut off from populating the new worlds or setting their mark on them” A17 * “The French were Great Britain’s most dangerous potential competitors, but their government was always likely to be distracted by its European continental commitments.” A18 * “The British lacked missionary zeal … they had no immediate urge to interfere with the native custom or institution” A19 * “Before its outbreak, there had in fact been no remission of fighting in India, even while France and Great Britain were officially at peace after 1748.” A20 * “The possession of a station at Calcutta placed them at the door to that part of India which was potentially the richest prize - Bengal and the lower Ganges valley.” A21 * Mason * “A long struggle between Parliament and the Stuart kings <span>[</span>in England?<span>]</span> and essentially replaced the absolute monarchy with a constitutional monarchy” A22 * “ ‘Sovereign power resides in my person alone …. It is from me alone that my policies take their existence and their authority’ ” A23 * “European monarchies had consciously pursued a policy of the balance of power, a system of shifting international alliances that prevented any one country from becoming too powerful” A24 * “Wars were fought not so much for ideology or nationalism but to maintain the balance of power … The victor did not want to crush the vanquished” A25 * “Napoleon formed mass armies and led them into other countries to spread the ideas of the Revolution and to enhance his own power” A26 * “The French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars had unleashed forces that would shake the foundations of European society.” A27 * “Napoleon had changed the nature of warfare in Europe by conscripting huge armies and infusing them with a commitment to fight for France and for ‘liberty, equality, and fraternity,’ the slogan of the Revolution.” A28</p>
