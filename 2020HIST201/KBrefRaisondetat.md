```
The nemesis of raison d’état is overextension- over focused on expansion and safety of the state, everything is about defending/extending the state- similar Tilly’s perspective: war makes states and states make war- amoral- Louis XIV over-extended
- overextension of raison d’etat has 2 possible endings: (1) others form a coalition against the ruthless nation
Or (2) the ruthless nation achieves world dominance End result of (1) —> Balance of PowerOnce all states played by the same rules, gains became much more difficult to achieve. Result of (2) is unipolarity / world hegemony
