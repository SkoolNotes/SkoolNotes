From Sushu Xia to Everyone: (9:31 AM)
 - overextension of raison d’etat has 2 possible endings: (1) others form a coalition against the ruthless nation 
From Sushu Xia to Everyone: (9:31 AM)
 Or (2) the ruthless nation achieves world dominance End result of (1) —> Balance of Power Once all states played by the same rules, gains became much more difficult to achieve. Result of (2) is unipolarity / world hegemony
