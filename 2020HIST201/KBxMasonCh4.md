# Mason? Chapter... 4? 


- 1848 bunch of monarchies overthrown 
- within a few years, all the revolutions failed / were reversed 
- Individualism was growing due to the enlightenment and romance art (the kind we learned about in english last year)
- 'hodgepodge' of states

## Liberalism and nationalism in the early nineteenth century 

- liberalism and nationlisk originated in the enlightenment, 
- started to contradict conservative values
- two types:
	- political liberalism
		- goverment by consent
		- constitutionalism
		- tolerence of differing points of view
		- > that one person’s free- dom could be restricted only if it impinged on the individual freedom of another: “The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.”
	- economic liberalism
		-  derived from adam smith's the wealth of nations (eyy) 
		-  about the invisible hand 
		-  also want to limit the power of the governernment, but mostly in relation to the economy
	-  about difference in emphasis
	-  grew alot in the 19th century with the growing middle class
	
	-  also nationalism was a thing
	-  some guy in the 18th century 
		-  > “Neither pope nor king,” he declared, “only God and the people.” Later, he created an international branch of his organization, Young Europe, which trained a network of conspirators across the Continent to agitate for democratic constitutions.



## precursors to 1848: the 1830 revolution in france 

- liberal and national movements (both anti goverment ig)
- revolted a bunch in the early 1800's 
- like greece against the ottomans, who won! 
- one of frances leaders tried to revoke a bunch of the progress people had made, and the society rioted and he fled
- end of the 'bourbon' monarchy? #what? 



## the actual revolution of 1848 

- recession and food shortages led to unrest (1846-47)
- and the people had less power 
- the monarch fled again 
- during the industrial revolution! 
- socialism starts gaining traction... 
- > In the Bloody June Days of June 24 to 26, several thousand people were killed and eleven thousand insurgents were imprisoned or deported. The specter of socialist revolution had been suppressed, but the events of June sent a shudder through all the governments of Europe. 
- and then napolean comes and totally dissolves the democracy 
- wheeee



## revolt spreads through europe

-  this one's pretty self explanatory
