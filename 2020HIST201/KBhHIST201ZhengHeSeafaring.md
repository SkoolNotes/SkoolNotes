# Ming China's Seafaring
**Zheng He's Expedition**: Famous official overseas official expedition

## The Fleet
Hugely built ships:

* Dry docks @fact
* Precious metals
* High tech
    * Double hulls
    * Watertight compartments
    * Rustproofed nails
    * Mechanical pumps
* Zheng He's flagship was the largest ship ever constructed

## The Guy
* Zheng He @fact
    * Captured from war
    * Supported a uncle-usurp-nephew coup
    * Put in charge of the sea expeditions
    
## The Goals
* Viewed as way of announcing China's prowess @[[KBhHIST201MannMing]]
* Seeked tribute and coordination from other nations @fact
* Forced others to acknowledge Beijing
* Kept peace in the surrounding regions of the expedition
    * Subjugated a misbehaving Chinese enclave in Sumatra
    * Intervened in a civil war in Java
    * Invaded Sri Lanka
    * Wiped out Sumatran bandits
* Politically announced China's presence @[[KBhHIST201MannMing]]
    * Sheer size of the ships scared the bejessus out of everyone
    * Added tribunes to China
    * Ships returned with great gifts/weird things
        * Giraffs — as… entertainment
        * A chief — for he did not acknowledge the emperor

## The Expeditions
* Began 1405 ended 1433 @fact
* Traveled around much of the Indian Ocean => Southern Africa

## The End
@[[KBhHIST201MannMing]]

* Became target in political infighting 
* Son aligned with opposition party's ideas, cancelling the trips

The exact causes and reasons why this happened is still speculated. According to [[KBhHIST201MannMing]] (C. Mann's) 1500s Ming, this ending of the expedition marked a point at which China turned inwards from a trade perspective.
