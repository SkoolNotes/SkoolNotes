# Literally All the Things
## Ottomans
### Ottoman military replaced cavalry with Janissaries to save money and be more effective, but it backfired
#source bulliet
- Ottoman military was originally made of cavalry and Janissaries
- Cavalry were paid with land, while Janissaries were paid with money. Janissaries were also more effective under devshirme 
- to regain land, government squeezed out cavalry 
- Inflation from south american silver also caused fixed currency peoples to struggle
- all this led to revolt (cavalry + suddenly poor people)
- Janissaries took advantage to make "Janissication" hereditary and marry/start businesses
- Revolts + Ended up costing more -> government struggling

### Ottomans didn't produce their own metals, so it all got traded away
#source bulliet
- European silver created a wave of inflation, where european traders had more silver than ottoman internal merchants
- Safavid Iran also needed precious metals so they traded with the ottomans for it, which meant the ottomans had even hard money
- Some use of copper coins which were inflation resistant?

### "penetration of European merchant capital"
#source cleveland
- ottoman merchants traded raw materials for european manufactured products
	- benefited merchants, hurt government revenues
	- lack of raw materials caused inflation
	- This meant government couldn't pay military
	
### Capitulations
#source cleveland
- treaties originally meant to encourage international trade
- later exploited by european merchants with stronger military to back them up


#### First Capitulation
- Signed with france in 1536
	- french merchants could trade with low taxes, etc in ottoman ports
	- merchants would be punished under french law
- See example: #source primary-franc-ottoman-treaty

### Government weakening
#source cleveland
- Caused by inflation
- government workers were on a fixed wage
	- when in inflation happened, they were not paid enough
	- were more likely to take bribes and "other forms of corruption"
	- lead to declining military -> embarassing treaties -> Treaty of Küchük Kay-narja (1774) -> Russia meddling with ottoman politics
	- "technological advantage lost"

## Kennedy Bashing on People
### Ming
- "sheer conservatism of the Confucian bureaucracy"
- "did not reassess" when people appeared off the coast
- "dislike of commerce and private capital"
- restricted technology (canals, clocks, printing)
- spent money on land and education instead of technology
### Ottomans
- "falter, to turn inward, and to lose the chance of world domination"
- strategical overextension
- many enemy states around (after crazy fast expansion)
- incompetent sultans in succession
	- "an idiot sultan could paralyze the ottoman empire in the way that a pope or holy roman emperor could never do for all europe"
- lack of expansion after 1550 caused Janissaries to turn to internal plunder
- merchants (many foreign) may be seized
### Similarities in Kennedy's eyes
- conservative
- stopped military expansion/exploration
- incompetent leaders
- doesn't like merchants
