# Causes of WWI: European Tensions Building

## Europeans' Blindness
Claim @[[KBhHIST201PalmerCh17]] 

Throughout the early 19th century, Europeans believed that their technological innovations would defuse conflicts and bring overall happiness due to the fear of fighting. Owning to this, they maintained huge standing armies due to fears of internal conflicts and to keep peace.

These are quite powerful armies --- a la... Britian, for instance -- which had one of if not *the* largest navy on the planet at the time.

## German Growth
German unity brought boom in industry in especially the Germanic states but also all of Europe => Germans wanted street cred ("a place in the sun") for all their industrialization. This is a little scary for folks because th

- Otto von Bismark feared that the new Germany could be broken by war, so tried to keep peace.
	- Bismark signed two sets of treaties. The first forming the **Triple Alliance**, which lead to the alliance of AustriaHungary, Italy, and Germany. 
	- Also signed a second reverse insurance treaty with Russia, an enemy of the first.
	- The reverse insurance alliance with Russia was way to finagly, which lead to it collapsing under Bismark’s successors and eventually lead to France signing a treaty with Russia.

## Alliances Forming 
At this point! Two camps began to form: the German-Austrian-Italian alliance vs. the French-Russian. 

Sprints of cross-floor coopreation did occur but unstable and rare.

**Everyone was looking at Britian because what they did determined how the BOP will be constructed/disrupted. They prided themselves on isolation and the lack of alliance, but when Germany supported Boers in Boers vs. Britian, conflict began to brew.**


## The Germans built a navy.
- By 1898-1912, the Germans rapidly grew their naval power — originally an important source of British power. The Brits feel threatened.
- The British policy of always having the biggest navy lead them to enter an arms race vs. Germany.
- The British government slowly began a series of diplomatic actions that resulted in a readjustment of relationships with the French, a convention with Russia, and eventually leading the three to form an unofficial alliance + “act together”. CLAIM: this perhaps is the immediate cause of the war.

- At this point, the three nations (E, F, R) of the “Triple Entente” were acting together against the “Triple Alliance” (G, I, A).

## Testing the Relationship
Kaiser William II attempted to test the relationship between France and England, making a speech directly against the French claim in Morocco. Britian backend the French side, and because of this tactic, the two strengthed relationship in fear of the common Germanic enemy.

A gunboat appeared in Agadir and demanded that the French give up some of the congo. British cabinet David Lloyd George protested this.

Slavic nationalists believe that Germanic Dual-Monarchy will not grant them enough rights as a culture, so nationalism caused part of Austria to want to join Serbia.
