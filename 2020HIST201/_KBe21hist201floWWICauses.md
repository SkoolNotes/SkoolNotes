# germany and russia are both looking each other with paranoia

# because germany industrialized fast and russia has lots of people

# from 1880 to 1913, germany\'s manufacturing output share (of the world) doubles (table 18)

# table 19: everybody is amassing military, and nobody can be sure that the others aren\'t going to attack ([security dilemma](KBrefSecurityDilemma.org))

# table 20: great britain builds up it\'s navy (and is scared of germany because they\'ve gone from 88k to 1.3M tons)

## dreadnaughts: germany comes up with a ship that makes all others obsolete, and an expensive arms race insues
