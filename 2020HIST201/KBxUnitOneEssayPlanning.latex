Essay option 1: In the early modern period, three of the four major power centers of the world unified under multi-ethnic, multi-religious empires (the Qing in East Asia, the Mughals in South Asia, and the Ottomans in the Middle East), while Europe remained politically fragmented into multiple, competitive independent states. Why was no European power able to unify their local state system the way the Asian land empires did? In a well-organized essay, answer this question by comparing Europe to any two of the above empires. Your essay should cite evidence from a variety of secondary sources from the unit pdf. A strong essay will use the sources as evidence for both specific historical events that demonstrate your thesis as well as for broader concepts and trends. All sources from the Unit 1 reader are fair game, including what we read before the last essay. 

Essentially, why coudnt they centralize? Compare and contrast essay. 

Essay option 2: According to Charles Tilly’s “bellicist” theory of state formation, states form to protect a territory from external threats. In the process of doing this (war-making), they develop the tools to eliminate internal rivals as well (state-making), and in order to fund these endeavours, they develop institutions like taxation to raise revenue from their territory (extraction). In order to maximize the wealth available for extraction and prevent property owners from needing private armies to protect themselves, the state establishes rule of law to protect property rights (protection). Using this theory as a starting point, compare state formation in two or three of the four regions we have studied (Europe, India, China, and the Middle East/North Africa): your goal should be to highlight an interesting contrast and pose a causal explanation for this contrast. Your essay should cite evidence from a broad variety of secondary sources from the unit pdf. A strong essay will use the sources as evidence for both specific historical events that demonstrate your thesis as well as for broader concepts and trends. All sources from the Unit 1 reader are fair game, including what we read before the last essay.

Bellicist theory: war making doesnt directly lead to statemaking. War
making leads to need for statemaking which leads to statemaking or
collapse.

This is an imporant distinction that must be made \{becuaseeeeeee\}

it allows us to say things that threaten the state lead to state making,
effectively :)

The nesscecity for the state leads to its creating. Ie. if the state
gets hit, and its power is decreased, the cause of the hit can still be
counted as an equivalent to war-making.

    ``Contemptuous of European ideas and prac· tices, the Turks declined
    to adopt newer methods for containing plagues; consequently, their
    populations suffered more from severe epidemics. In one truly
    amazing fit of obscurantism, a force of janissar- ies destroyed a
    state observatory in 1580, alleging that it had caused a plague.''
    Kennedy, 12
  \item
    There was little improvement in communica- tions, and no machinery
    for assistance in the event of famine, flood, and plague-which were,
    of course, fairly regular occurrences. \emph{kenndey, 13}

  Inflation

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    In the late sixteenth century, inflation caused by a floodof cheap
    silver from the New World (see Environ- ment and Technology: Metal
    Currency and Inflation), affectedmany of the remaining landholders,
    who col- lected taxes according to legally fixed rates. Some saw
    theirpurchasing power decline so much that they could notreport for
    military service. \emph{Bulliet, 491}
  \item
    In the six- teenth and seventeenth centuries, however, precious
    metal poured into Spain from silver and gold mines in the New World,
    but there was no increase in the availability of goods and services.
    The resulting infla-tion triggered a ``price revolut ion'' in
    Europe-a gen- eral tripling of prices between 1500 and 1650. In
    Paris in 1650 the price of wheat and hay was fifteen times higher
    than the price had been in 1500. \emph{Bulliet, 494}
  \item
    As a result, the country faced the unsolvable problem of finding
    money to pay the army and bureauc- racy. \emph{Bulliet, 500}
  \item
    First, governments through- out Eurasia had attempted to displace
    the warlords and tame the aristocracies that had provided services
    to the crown by building armies and bureaucracies loyal to the
    central government alone. Building these armies and bureaucracies
    was expensive, and soldiers and bureaucrats had to be paid.
    Inflation raised the costs of maintaining them in the manner to
    which they had grown accustomed. \emph{gelvin, 33-34}
  \item
    States spen t an enormous amount of money to sustain their emp
    loyees. In Persia, for examp le, an estimated 38 percent of the
    state's expendi tures went to the army. Another 41 percent went to
    the imperial harem, the royal family, and royal attendants. States
    competed with the private sector for resources, and this drove up
    prices. \emph{gelvin, 35}
  \item
    This complicated situation resulted in revolts that devastated
    Anatolia between 1590 and 1610. Former landholding cavalrymen,
    short-term soldiers released at the end of a campaign, peasants
    overburdened by emer- gencytaxes, and even impoverished students of
    religion formed bands of marauders. \emph{bulliet, 491}

Charles Tilly is famously quoted as stating ``War makes states and
states make war'' (Systems and States, 10). He lays out a theory of
state making, claiming that a state has four primary functions: war
making, protection, extraction, and of course, state making. Simply put,
war making stems from the need to protect a territory, which then leads
to extraction, protection, and state making. Tilly leaves out the
obvious, which is that failure to achieve one of these functions would
lead to a crash. War making does not lead to state making if one loses
the war. \{diagram\} Tilly dubbed this idea ``Bellicist Theory,''
bellicist meaning one who advocates for war. However, the error in this
theory is in the namesake itself. Tilly overgeneralizes\{wc\}, ignoring
many other causes that lead to state making in the same way that war
making does. To amend this, `need' should be in place of war making.
\{diagram\} For war making, this need would be the need for protection
against an enemy army, or the need for resources as acquired through war
making. Throughout the course of this essay, I will examine places in
which this amended Bellicist theory functions and normal Bellicist
theory does not.

The Bellicist theory remains consistent when war making is replaced with
plague, a biological attack. Effective mitigation of plague requires a
level of organization higher than a single person can achieve. Instead,
it requires protection as provided by the state, perhaps taking the form
of sanitation mandates or information as opposed to the formation of an
army. This protection would require extraction, which, with the same
logic as originally applied with war making, would lead to state making.
An example of this occurrence--in the negative--can be found in the late
1500s during the fall of the Ottoman empire. Kennedy reports,
``Contemptuous of European ideas and practices, the Turks declined to
adopt newer methods for containing plagues;'' (citation). Due to this
lack of new method adoption, the Ottomans did not follow the modified
Bellicist theory \{wc\}, and hence, ``suffered more from severe
epidemics'' (citation). Instead, the Ottomans opted for methods such as
destroying state observatories, ``alleging that it had caused a plague''
(citation). This failure to achieve the primary functions of the state,
as described by Tilly, ultimately aided in the downfall of the Ottoman
Empire.

Just like physical attack and biological attack, income attack\{wc,
intent?\} also leads to state making. Income attack can manifest in many
ways, one of which is inflation. When inflation occurred\{tense?\}, many
countries whose ``soldiers and bureaucrats had to be paid,'' ``faced the
unsolvable problem of finding money to pay the army and
bureaucracy''(Citation, gelvin, bulliet). During the late sixteenth
century, a flood of silver from Spain caused massive inflation, leading
to the problem described above. This event has been dubbed the ``price
revolution{[}, with{]} a general tripling of prices between 1500 and
1650''(citation bulliet). This price revolution forced the Ottoman
Empire to implement ``emergency taxes,'' or, in other words, extraction
(citation). In the Ottoman Empire, this inflation was so extreme that
soldiers, peasants, bureaucrats, ``and even impoverished students of
religion formed bands of marauders''(citation bulliet). These marauders
turned to internal plundering, and, expectedly, the government attempted
to eliminate them. This process lines up exactly with Tilly's precise
definition of state making: ``The act of eliminating internal rival
forces and insurgents from within its own territories'' (citation). This
elimination was of course an act of protection, and thus, it can be seen
that income attack can be a replacement for war making while keeping
Bellicist theory consistent.

A final example is ideological attack.

A way states control their people is through a shared, commonly
theological, ideology. When a competing ideology is introduced, this
threatens the state's control,
