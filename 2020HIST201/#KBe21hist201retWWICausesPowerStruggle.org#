* germany and russia are both looking each other with paranoia
* because germany industrialized fast and russia has lots of people
* from 1880 to 1913, germany's manufacturing output share (of the world) doubles (table 18)
* table 19: everybody is amassing military, and nobody can be sure that the others aren't going to attack ([[file:KBrefSecurityDilemma.org][security dilemma]])
* table 20: great britain builds up it's navy (and is scared of germany because they've gone from 88k to 1.3M tons)
** dreadnaughts: germany comes up with a ship that makes all others obsolete, and an expensive arms race insues
** we can't be sure what people's motives were, can only look at old correspondences and journals
* alliances map
** french and british are teamed (which is strange because they'd been fighting)
*** although maybe it makes sense geographically, and they are both afraid of germany
** austria-hungary is very culturally diverse, which makes alliances awkward
*** italy might want italians back from austria
*** generally austrian civilians may not want to fight for austria
* alliances map again (but changes)
** italy is on the allied side now
** the ottoman empire (bulgaria too) have joined germany
*** ottomans have beef with both the austrians and russians
* colonial shenanigans in north africa
