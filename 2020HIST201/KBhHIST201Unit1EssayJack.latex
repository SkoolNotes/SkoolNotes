Economic: The Ottomans, the Ming and Qing Empires, the Mughals and the
European kingdoms all responded to the globalization of commerce in the
early modern period in dramatically different ways. \textbf{Why did they
respond differently to the globalization of commerce and what were the
consequences?} Comparing at least two of the regions above. Gelvin
(World systems), Mann (silver), Kennedy and Arrighi might be good
general frameworks, while Bulliet (Ottomans), Gilbert (Mughals) and
McNeill (Europe) can provide some specifics.

Musing: * Attempting to reach world hegemony in a multiculturalistic
state will cause eventual economic infiltration and a loss of identity,
whereas reliance on unification and control to achieve hegemony will
result in economic implosion and loss of control. * So\ldots{} Per
Arrigi * A ``territorialist model'' =\textgreater{} economic implosion\\
* Ming w/ the Mann * A ``capitalist model'' =\textgreater{} economic
infiltration

If you too multicultural, you may end up loosing your economic control.
Empires are trying to include all these cultures in one territory.

The Ottomans, for instance, Established trade agreements ``Such trade
agreements, called capitulations, led to European domination of Ottoman
seaborne trade. \ldots{} Far from seeing Europe as the enemy that would
eventually dismantle the empire, the Istanbul elite experimented with
European clothing and furniture styles'' =\textgreater{} new styles
infiltrated the government causing a lack of response or even
capitulation (Bulliet)

If you tried to overly unify your cultural identity, you may end up
loosing your civil control.

Mughals =\textgreater{} tried model of unity --- loosing support of
Hindu nobels ``The combination of anti-Hindu policy and sentiment at
court and the reduction in the value of subsidies or land grants to
Maratha mansab dars turned Shivaji into not merely a rebel but a
rival.'' =\textgreater{} causing the series of decline that the Mughals
saw initiated with the Maratha rebelion.

If you try to, instead, exercise balance and raíson de'etat, happiness
to everyone!

English example =\textgreater{} ``England's policy was based on throwing
its weight as the occasion required to the weaker and more threatened
side to redress the equilibrium. \ldots{} England was the one European
country whose raison d 'etat did not require it to expand in Europe.
Perceiving its national interest to be in the preservation of the
European balance''

And yes, there is a point where Raison de etat turns into
territorialism. But, that becomes no longer Raison de etat, that's a
tour de force: " Richelieu's raison d'etat threatens self- destructive
tours de force\ldots. But Louis XN gained no peace of mind from
security; he saw in it an opportunity for conquest. In his overzealous
pursuit of raison d'etat, LouisXN alarmed the rest of Europe and brought
together an anti-French coalition which, in the end, thwarted his
design."

So what? So be the third thing.

Now, defluffify by re-writing the three points + so what in as little
words as possible.

**When attempting to reach world system hegemony, overextention of
multicultralism will bring forth a lack of economic control whereas
overunification of cultural identity will cause losses in civic control.
