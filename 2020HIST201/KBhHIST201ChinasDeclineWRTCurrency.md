# China's Decline: Currency
After a less-then-successful [[KBhHIST201ChinasDeclineWRTReopening]] reopening after [[KBhHIST201ZhengHeSeafaring]] Zheng He's expeditions, there was a run on currency that cause hyper in- and de- flation due to incapable leadership and faulty systems. This caused a reliance on silver, which brings with it [[KBhHIST201ProblemsWithSilver]] silver problems.


## A little history lesson...
[[KBhHIST201MannMing]] (C. Mann's) 1500s Ming

* Originally started as bronze coins
* Became inefficient and so started printing paper money
* Bronze production could not match paper money
    * Paper money became _fiat money_— had purchasing power but no backing
    * But! Fiat money is usually good for government
        * Not influenced by metal prices
        * Could be decoupled and printed at will  
        * Which.… Resulted in the Yuan overdoing it and inventing **hyperinflation**
        
## Ming vs. Hyperinflation
[[KBhHIST201MannMing]] (C. Mann's) 1500s Ming

* China tried to counter inflation by not printing money
    * Caused economic hardship
    * Deflation to the point where merchants are starting to accept counterfeits
    * One emperor came up with the brilliant idea of counterfit-proof currency, but that only helped adoption for about a year
    * Emperors kept banning and failing to ban currencies
        * Used the strategy of "your money is not worth it anymore" to prevent hyperinflation
        * Unfortunately, caused problems surrounding the fact that currency as a whole became untrustworthy

> Government policies were often accidental by-products of ministerial intrigues

This widespread distrust of currencies caused the Ming to leverage...

## Silver!
[[KBhHIST201MannMing]] (C. Mann's) 1500s Ming

* People resorted to carrying around silver, which was… better, but it is quite inefficient as well => coins ultimately made up 1/10ths of transactions
    * Government gave in, started asking for taxes in silver too
    * Creating unhealthy feedback loop leading to [[KBhHIST201ProblemsWithSilver]] Problems with Silver
        * People sold silk and porcelain to side silver merchants
        * Used silver to pay taxes
        * Taxes fund operations against silver merchants
        * "Ming government was at war with its own money supply"
    * Eventually, government gave in and allowed people to trade overseas with, sigh..., silver, ushering in [[KBhHIST201ProblemsWithSilver]] Problems with Silver
