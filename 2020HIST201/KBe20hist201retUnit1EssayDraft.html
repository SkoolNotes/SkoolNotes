            <p>Europeans used soft power to mislead the Ottoman empire into trading agreements that caused cripling inflation and corruption, a corrosive trend that lead ultamately to the Ottoman empire’s downfall. The Capitulations of the mid sixteenth century were a seriese of trade agreements between the militarily dominant Ottoman empire and the various states of Europe designed to facilitate trade (Cleveland 50). Because the European nations were weaker than the Ottomans at the time, the Ottoman empire felt safe and philantrophic in the negotiation of the treaties. Not only did the Capitulations promise truce at war and zero additional import and export taxes, they also served as a sign of political trust. Even in early drafts of the treaties, the Ottomans grant the French consul juristiction over it’s nationals on empire soil. One draft from 1535 states that a French consul is to be maintained in the "proper authority" to "determine all causes, suits, an differences, both civil and criminal, which might arise between merchants and other subjects of the King" (Hurewitz 3). Although this is an early draft of the treaty, the loophole spawn of the Ottoman downfall is already apparent–the French see it as "proper" that they should have juristiction in another country. Why did the Ottomans give the French so much power? Such power is often granted by weaker, surrendering states, but in this case the privellage is granted primarily to the French. The Ottomans are still in their age of military domination–continuing to clean battles until the late sixteenth century. The drafting of this Capitulation came before the wave of Spanish silver, which was only discovered in 1545, a decade later. Ultamately, the Ottomans ratified this treaty to inspire confidence in the French and to encourage the weaker state to trade–a strategic move to control international commerce by a wealthy and powerful land empire. After all, the foreign bailiffs wouldn’t dare abuse the treaty… not in the face of the mighty Ottoman empire. The strong military of the Ottoman empire campaigned against various states of Europe, and secured another Capitulation with each victory. Europe’s internal international policy of Raison d’etat meant all of Europe was willing to backstab and gain control–a system of balance that discouraged long periods of alturistic trade (Kissinger 69). This conflict in Europe and easy trade with the Ottomans facilitated a boom in international commerce. The citizens of the Ottoman empire enjoyed the benefits of active foreign trade: they had tariff-less access to manufactured products from all accross Europe. The Ottoman machine ran smoothly, until a sudden influx of silver turned the system on its head and set a vicious cycle of inflation, weakening, and revolt in motion. In the late sixteenth century, European who were suddenly bloated with silver started trading at outbidding the Ottomans for their raw materials (Bulliet 494). As Ottoman raw materials were inceasingly traded for European manufactured goods, the Ottoman military found it increasingly difficult to arm themselves and fight effectively (Bulliet 491). Furthermore, the tightknit trade relation between the Ottomans and Europe created a wave of inflation as Ottoman exporters got their hands on the influx of silver. Coincidentally, the fixed salary land holding cavalrymen were becoming increasingly irrelevant in modern warfare and the government was looking for a way to regain control of it’s territory. When the wave of inflation prevented the cavalrymen from reporting to service, the government siezed their land and used the taxes to pay the ever increasing well trained and highly effective Janassaries (Bulliet 491). As the economy inflated, the livelihoods of state employees, students, and professors living on fixed salaries became impossible to maintain, these citizens formed "bands of marauders" who staged revolts that required ever expensive military action to quell (Bulliet 491). To accelerate the corrosion, the Janassaries took advantage of the confusion to make their position hereditary and abolish the selective recruitment process. Although this saved money on paper, the "increase in total number of Janassaries and their steady deterioration as a military force more than offset these savings," (BUlliet 491). Through this chain of events, European trade induced inflation fed a cycle of revolt and military deficiency, allowing more revolt and further increasing the need for military expenditure. To cap it all off, the powers granted to the consuls by the originally advantageous Capitulations were abused with "increasing frequency," and the Ottoman system only accelarated on it’s downwards spiral (Cleveland 50). This is how Europe bested the Ottomans: a set of exploitable treaties signed under differing circumstances and an influx of inflation targeting an indexterous wage system stiffled down a branch of military with outdated techniques and allowed civil unrest to weaken the empire internally.</p>

            <h1 id="body-3-ming">Body 3: Ming</h1>
            <p>Unlinke the Ottomans, the Ming empire was having money troubles before European trades showed up. China opened up to European trade to reverse it’s existing deflationary spiral, creating a European dependence on Chinese trade that ultamately incentivised it’s destruction. Since the twelvth century, Chinese currency had been highly volatile. As each ruler realized the "virtues of an active printing press", inflation exploded until the next emperor banned use of the previous currency and issued his own (Mann 136). Eventually, merchants grew tired of unreliable government currency, and started paying their dues with ingots and shards of silver. To evaluate the <span>[</span>silvers<span>]</span> purity, they used <span>[</span>silvermasters<span>]</span>, who charged a fee for the evaluation and routinely cheated all parties" (Mann 138). However, silver was a scarce commodity. Wang Xijue, a Ming dynasty court official, wrote in 1593 that grain prices dropped despite poor harvests due to the deflation of silver. "As the price of grain falls, tillers of the soil recieve lower returns on their labors, and thus less land is put into cultivation," (DBQ Doc 3). That the emperor is recieving and tolorating reports of the issues with silver currency show how helpless the situation is–the Ming empire already relied on silver, yet the veins of it’s economy were starved of blood. It was only until the Portuguese appeared that the Ming economy could assimilate the silver it needed to function. Three decades into the critical silver deficit, a report from Ming dynasty court official He Qiao Yuan suggests a route to salvation. He writes "Chinese silk yarn worth 100 bars of silver can be sold in the Philippines at a price of 200 to 300 bars," and suggests the possibility of repealing international trade bans to accumulate silver (DBQ Doc 7). Although not explicitly stated, trade in the Philipinnes would revitalize the Ming economy–the effective amount of silver could double per transaction. As Mann puts it, "the unexpected discovery of silver-bearing foreigners in the Philippines was <span>[</span>…<span>]</span> a godsend," (Mann 139). Unlike the Ottomans, who had an effective system of government and trade before the European flood of silver, the Ming economy struggled to find enough silver to function. The European influx of silver actually boosted the Ming economy, whose hunger for silver created an inseperable trade relation with Europe. As English scholar Charels D’Avenant wrote "But since Europe has tasted of <span>[</span>Chinese<span>]</span> luxury, it can never be advisable for England to quit this trade, and leave it to any other nation," (DBQ Doc 8).</p>
