The political scientist Kenneth Waltz argues that the causes of war can be analyzed at three different levels: the individual human level, the state level, and the international system level. Those who view things from the first level believe that war is best explained by “selfishness,” “misdirected aggressive impulses,” or “stupidity” within the human psyche.

Those who favor the second level believe there are hostile or aggressive or revisionist states who, because of their form of government or other domestic issues, behave in a warlike manner while other states simply want to keep the peace (the status quo).

Those who favor the third level believe that the international system itself, because it is an anarchy with “no system of law enforceable” between states, and in which each state acts according to its own interest and reserves the right to use force to achieve its aims, makes war inevitable.

Analyze World War 1 according to one (or a blend) of these levels of analysis. Which best explains the general causes of the war as well as the specific sequence of events (*including events that prolonged the war beyond the initial outbreak*)?

Essays should cite from the Palmer reading, and, if you want to aim for the exemplary evidence standard, any of these [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KTggTDz3Yl7fT9MxwG4l25qMPNyiUioe?usp=sharing][primary sources as well]].


Other Submission guidelines: 3 pages, size 12 font, double-spaced. Citations should be in-line and formatted as (Authorname Pagenumber) i.e. (Kennedy 12). Include a Works Cited page in MLA format for the secondary sources. Primary sources do not need to be included in the Works Cited page, but their authorship and date and other relevant information should be introduced in your text when you cite them.

Tips: See the essay rubric guide below for questions to ask yourself as you write and revise.

** intro
   don't actually need much/anything here, as long as the thesis is understandable

** DONE thesis
   Although a lack of enforcement of international order both incentivized and prolonged WWI, the necessary spark was provided by individual civilian ambitions.

** TODO BP1: level 3 security dilemma/cult of the offensive puts everyone on edge
   Reinforcing international incentives such as the security dilemma and cult of the offensive put each of the international powers on edge, bringing the European powers closer to war.

*** industrialization -> bigger militaries
   As a united Germany industrialized, both its population and industrial might grew to rival the French and British powers of the time. For instance, in 1880--just three years after Germany was officially unified--the German empire produced only 8.5% of the world's manufacturing output while Britain produce 22.9% of it. By 1913, Germany had surpassed British production and nearly doubled that of France's (Kennedy, Table 18).

   Contries tend to grow their military as they industrialize, if only for defensive purposes. As Germany doubled it's military population, nearby countries grew wary. As surpassed power and a failing empire, France and Russia grew wary of the newfound power between them. They allied with Britain in 1904 and 1907 respectively for fear of a coming war.

*** the security dilemma
	As countries formed aliances and grew their militaries, opposing parties were forced to keep up in the arms race. This so called "security dilemma" doubled the number of military and navel personel worldwide in the 30 years between the German unification and the war, and nearly tripled the global warship tonnage (Kennedy, Table 19-20). A level two perspcetive would explain this aggression with Germany's expansionistic ideals, but even Britain's liberal parlimentary democracy quadrupled it's naval tonnage.

*** cult of the offensive
	Leaders at the time believed that preempting war would allow a fast and decisive victory. Even simplifying the outcomes to two countries and four possibilites, where each country either attacks or defends, greedy actors will choose to preempt war. As a result, each country prepared to invade it's neighboors, and European tensions grew.

*** mutually assured destruction
	In fact, had a there been an international disencentive such as Mutually Assured Destruction, the relative ordering of possibilites and therefore the cost matrix would've prevented all out war between such parties. For example, in a nuclear scenerio where any attacked country can retaliate with their own warheads, the utility of each scenerio would be ordered as follows:

	| Utility | Our Actions | Their Actions |
	|---------+-------------+---------------|
	|       4 | Defend      | Defend        |
	|       3 | Attack      | Defend        |
	|       2 | Attack      | Attack        |
	|       1 | Defend      | Attack        |

	And in a two party system,

	| Top,Left | Attack | Defend |
	|----------+--------+--------|
	| Attack   | 2, 2   | 1, 3   |
	| Defend   | 3, 1   | 4, 4   |

	Although it may seem less risky for any given party to attack, the utility of both defend increases as weapons get stronger until both parties opt for a defense strategy under MAD. Modern mutually assured destruction has so far prevented all out war, and a lack of such disincentives made war more likely in the early 1900s.

** TODO BP2: upset / war-hungry people are required to spark the war

   As a side effect of this global militarization, the populous glorified and anticipated war. This level three influence on the level one psyche inflamed nationalist ideals across Europe and primed a now-ticking explosive.

*** generally the people wanted to fight (partially caused by level 3)
	Popular works from the years leading up to the war describe how natural and necessary war is.

*** serbs in austria want to make yugoslavia (also bosnia?)



** TODO BP3: after the war continued, there was no backing down

*** mutanies -> people didn't want to fight anymore

*** TODO 'just outlast others' < shipping blockades
**** 4.14.8  "to starve out the enemy and ruin his economy was precisely the purpose"
**** famines
**** u boats @ civilan ships
*** war on others' turf
**** maybe just show an example - germany wants to keep the fight in belgium (invade france through belgium)
**** captials location
**** this is actually kind of level 3
