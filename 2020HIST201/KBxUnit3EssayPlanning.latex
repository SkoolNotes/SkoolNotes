Unit 3 Essay: 19th Century Transformations

Essay option 1: The political, economic, and technological transformations of the 19th century drastically changed the global power balance. In some cases, they made already strong states dramatically more powerful: witness Great Britain. In other cases, they paved the way for new, rising powers such as Japan, Germany, and Italy. And in still other cases, such as Egypt, India, China, Southeast Asia and Africa, they led to foreign intervention, imperialism and the loss of independence. What factor or factors most strongly determined which states would increase or decline in power in this time period (1815 to roughly 1900)? Answer this question with a thesis that addresses several, diverse examples from across the world. Tip: rather than accumulating a long, complex list of unrelated factors, simplify and pare down your thesis, saving the complexity for your examples.

Essay option 2:  According to Charles Tilly’s “bellicist” theory of state formation, states form to protect a territory from external threats. In the process of doing this (war-making), they develop the tools to eliminate internal rivals as well (state-making), and in order to fund these endeavours, they develop institutions like taxation to raise revenue from their territory (extraction). In order to maximize the wealth available for extraction and prevent property owners from needing private armies to protect themselves, the state establishes rule of law to protect property rights (protection). Insufficient state capacity in one of these domains is thus likely to affect the others. The 19th century is an especially interesting era in which to see this theory in action, as it witnesses the rise and fall of a number of new and old states. Using this theory as a starting point, compare and contrast state formation in two or three 19th century states we’ve studied this unit. You should have a thesis which points out a meaningful trend, disparity or hypothesis. 

Essay option 3: The post-1815 world was born from a massive ideological upheaval: The French Revolution and the subsequent spreading of liberal and nationalist ideals throughout an increasingly interconnected world. In the century to follow, nationalism and liberalism vied with each other as well as with other ideologies such as conservatism and socialism/communism. Blends of these existed as well. In an essay drawing upon specific examples from across the world, argue which of these ideologies was most transformative or important to understanding the events of the 19th century. Tip: the contrast between ideologies can help make your argument be more debatable and have more power-- show, for example, why liberalism had more of an impact than nationalism alone, or vice versa.

Note: Essays (either option) should cite from a wide variety of sources from the Unit 3 Reader. 

Other Submission guidelines: 3-4 pages, size 12 font, double-spaced. Citations should be in-line and formatted as (Authorname Pagenumber) i.e. (Kennedy 12). Include a Works Cited page in MLA format. 

Tips: See the essay rubric guide below for questions to ask yourself as you write and revise.

prompt 1:

about types of change?

more nuanced version of: conservative bad, innovation good

look at conservatives in china, say that cuased them to fall

look at britian and their innovation, led to their rise

say that change and innovation is not nesasarrily good, look at
communism

bad: about striking the balance

good: some sort of categorical diff -- changing tech vs human nature?
use vs users?

Need to fufill: - Uses diverse variety of evidence to support arguments
- Creates an argument with strong explanatory power and relevance to
both broader historical trends and specific moments in history

Japan was the model of modernization

interconection

huge amount of change

major driving factor was increase in interconnectivuity

reaction to itc

interconnecivity: increase in exanchge - goods and ideas

interconectivity inherently means a decrease in autonomy

The major deciding factor in a states change in power in the 19th
century was its willingness to embrace interconnectivity.

Britain heavily embraced interconnectivity, leveraging it for profit.
Trade, one of Britain's main sources of income, is one of the main ways
interconnectivity manifests. Britain heavily promoted trade, even going
to the lengths of taking territory from other states and turning it into
``important commercial and trading centers'' (mason). They focused on
developing a powerful navy, which became ``the largest in the world''
(kennedy). This navy effectively served as a tool for propagating
interconnectivity, as seafaring was the primary means of transferring
goods and ideas between states. They used this navy to enforce free
trade and manage trade routes, further promoting interconnectivity and
eventually leading to the ``spectacular growth of an integrated global
economy {[}\ldots{]} and financial network centered {[}\ldots{]} upon
Great Britain'' (kennedy). Of course, Britain benefited massively off of
this newly created integrated financial network, which, along with it's
goods, would spread ideas. Expanding and rising in power immensely,
Britain truly was one of the driving forces behind this
interconnectivity revolution.

After centuries of isolation, Japan accepted the interconnectivity
revolution and prospered because of it. During Japan's period of self
isolation, ``no Japanese was allowed to leave the islands or even to
build a ship large enough to navigate the high seas. No foreigner
{[}\ldots{]} was allowed to enter'' (palmer). Japan had little power,
little influence, and was the antithesis of an interconnected state.
This isolation continued until 1853, when ``the American Commodore Perry
forced his way with a fleet of naval vessels into Yedo Bay,'' initiating
Japan into the interconnectivity revolution. Commodore Perry demanded
that the Japanese engage in trade with the Western powers, and ``the
Japanese began to comply {[}\ldots{]} in 1867 an internal revolution
took place, of which the most conspicuous consequence was a rapid
westernizing of Japanese life and institutions'' (palmer). In what is
now called the Meiji era, spanning from 1868 to 1912, Japan experienced
a complete shift from isolation to being the model of a modern state.
Trade, ``almost literally zero in 1854, was valued at \$200 million a
year by the end of the century'' (palmer). Japan embraced
interconnectivity, exchanging and adopting ideas along with goods. This
exchange led to a massive increase in Japan's power, and they formed a
``newly westernized army and navy'' which was ``modeled on the British''
(palmer). This increase in power allowed Japan to defeat the Russians
and the Chinese, much ``to the world's amazement'' (palmer). Japan,
beginning as the very opposite of an interconnected state, accepted
interconnectivity, and gained ideas and goods which ultimately led to a
massive increase in their power.

China, starting in a similar situation as Japan, resisted the
interconnectivity revolution and suffered because of it. Initially,
China resisted free trade. They saw trade itself as a sort of of
charity, a privilege ``granted to less-developed `barbarians' in
exchange for their paying respects to the Son of Heaven and his court''
(ropp). They also heavily restricted trade, allowing it only in specific
ports and confining traders to but ``a few warehouses {[}\ldots{]} to
reside only temporarily to load and unload their ships.'' (ropp). This
outlook on trade --- and the policy that followed --- led to the
inevitable and increasing frustration of the British traders. Not only
did China resist the exchange of goods, but they also resisted the
exchange of ideas --- two key components in interconnectivity. In 1898,
``a brilliant Confucian scholar who admired Japan for its rapid adoption
of Western institutions and industrialization'' tried to do the same to
China (ropp). He issued a myriad of edicts, all based upon the idea of
sending China through a ``crash program of industrialization and
Westernization'' (ropp). Conservatives grew alarmed, and the reform
movement was easily and soundly crushed. Interconnectivity inherently
brings with it a loss in autonomy and tradition, and China's
unwillingness to sacrifice these led to it's downfall. Of course,
Britain released their navy upon China, and unlike the Japanese who
embraced the interconnectivity revolution, ``the Chinese had no naval
forces'' and were almost instantly defeated (ropp). The British mandated
free trade by force, and China became an unwilling part of the
interconnectivity revolution.
