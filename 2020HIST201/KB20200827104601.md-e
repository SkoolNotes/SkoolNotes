## Why do States Start?
 - One theory called social contract theory is that a state arises from the cumulative experience of a population's self-government as it grows and requires more and more coordination.
     - This has been used as a reference for state creation
 - Another theory called the Bellicist theory (formed by Charles Tilly) of the state says that states form to make war on other states.
     - States exist to control territory from external threats
     - States exist to eliminate internal rivals and insurgents
     - States exist to protect their people
     - States take taxes and and revenue to form a state

## How Bellicist works on a State.
 - An army is useful for both war making and state making according to Bellicist theory.
     - To be good at war making a state needs to efficiently tax it's people to be succesful at war making.
         - Can not be too much, or too little.
             - Needs to beat rival
         - Needs to make wealthy people buy into government and pay them taxes for protection.
             - Can lead to problematic policies as the wealthy people matter more for taxes
