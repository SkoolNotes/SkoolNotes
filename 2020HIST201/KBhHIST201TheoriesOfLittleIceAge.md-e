# Why the Little Ice Age Happened
While he cause of [[KBhHIST201LittleIceAge]] The Little Ice Age  is still unknown, there are some theories as to how this happened…

## Maunder Minimum
* Decreased sun spots causes less sun energy output
* Hence, the earth is cooled

## Volcano
* Earlier in the period, there had been volcanic activity
* Filipino volcanoes thought to deposit smoke, in which water droplets could have cooled the earth for ~3yrs

## Slash-and-burn theory
* Native Americans had a habit of clearing — whether through burning or slashing — forestland that could be used for farming. This reduces forests, so more $CO_2$ could be in the air
* The Europeans' influence of NA habit causes less of this to happen, making it be rather more Carbon Dioxide in the air
