# Ming China in the 1500s

## China has a lot going for it 
* Population 100-130 Mil (Europe has 50-55)
* Complicated and remarkable culture
* Large irrigated and fertile land

### Riches in technology
* Huge, state organized libraries
* Movable type printing
* Compass
* Large ships

### Advanced trade
* Stimulated by canal-building and pop. pressures
* Large iron industry for army and government
* Gunpowder
* Larger cities then medieval Europe

## Zheng He + Seafaring
Famous official overseas official expedition

* Seeked tribute and coordination from other nations
* Forced others to acknowledge Beijing
* Ships returned with great gifts/weird things
    * Giraffs — as… entertainment
    * A chief — for he did not acknowledge the emperor
* Apparently never plundered/murdered + killed only on Emperor's orders

### Decline in Seafaring
* China never had a free market?? #why
    * Banned overseas trade 
* Order in 1433 from new emperor apparently banned these missions

### Why China stopped seafaring
* Seafaring was costly, and did not help the Northern Mongol invasions (duh)
* Japanese pirates did show up, but so did the Portuguese, but apparently they didn't care, so why?
* The answer… CONFUCIANISM!
    * China is a conservative, Confucian country
        * Merchants are disliked
        * So are private capital
        * Armies are too!
        * A side note about tech
            * Confucianism actually does encourage tech
            * Simply requires building for knowledge or state purposes, and not for armies/private property
    * China attempted to emulate their "old ways", especially after the mongol clearing
    
## Germs + Steel
* Intensive farming caused depletion of land => but pop. is growing
* Per Malthus, this results in **Plague! Floods! War!**
