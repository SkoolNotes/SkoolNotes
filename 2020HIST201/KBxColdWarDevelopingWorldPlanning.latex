September, 1957: Eisenhower gives the command, and the CIA begins
planning its coup to overthrow Sukarno. 1958, it fails, forcing Sukarno
into greater reliance on the PKI --- the Communist party of Indonesia.
Sukarno gives his famous speech, declaring loudly to the United States:
``When any nation offers us aid with political strings attached, then I
will tell them, go to hell with your aid!'' America's influence over
Sukarno had been admitted and destroyed in one fell swoop. A year later,
Sukarno becomes the first to drop out of the United Nations.
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002070206502000205?journalCode=ijxa
Sukarno then gives another speech, recorded by Francis Galbraith, the
American embassy's Chief of Mission. Galbraith wrote, ``Sukarno declares
Indonesia in the camp of the Asian Communist countries and opposed to
the U.S.'' He continued, ``It would be fatuous to pretend that this
speech is other principally than a declaration of enmity for us.''
September 30, 1965: Another coup takes place, six top army generals are
seized and murdered. Suharto, a far right-wing general, takes Sukarno's
power. Followed by this transfer was the massacring of Indonesian
communists --- and alleged communists --- that left the country in
shock. Body count estimates range from hundreds of thousands to over a
million. The United States congratulated Suharto and supported him as he
then ruled as dictator. H. W. Brands, the author of \emph{The Limits of
Manipulation: How the United States Didn't Topple Sukarno}, claims that
America had virtually no involvement, and the transfer of power from
Sukarno to Suharto ``resulted instead from developments of essentially
Indonesian origin.''

it's importance in the Cold War.

To understand the events that took place in Indonesia, one must first
understand Indonesia's surrounding context. The initial coup took place
just a few years after Eisenhower's election. One year after the
election, the CIA successfully overthrew Mohammed Mossadegh, the Iranian
Prime Minister at the time. Another year later, the CIA toppled
Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz, replacing him with Carlos Castillo
Armas who instated a military dictatorship. It was a time of covert
operations and government manipulation in developing countries. The
second coup, leading to the transfer of power from Sukarno to Suharto
took place just at the start of the Cold War's height. Chronologically
in the middle of the Vietnam war, the United States feared Sukarno would
create a similar situation to South Vietnam. \{CITES!\}

Indonesia itself had incredible value to the United States during the
cold war. It's unique location contributed greatly to this value;
Indonesia spanned the sea lanes linking the Pacific and Indian Oceans,
providing a crucial choke-point. It also outflanked Vietnam, providing
crucial positioning to the ongoing war.
https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep05921.11?seq=1\#metadata\_info\_tab\_contents
Complimenting its locational and strategical advantages, Indonesia was
rich with natural resources. Along with an abundance of oil and natural
gas, it carried a slew of valuable metals. \{\}
https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-are-the-major-natural-resources-of-indonesia.html

However, H. W. Brands argues that America had virtually no involvement
with the coup that took down Sukarno and replaced him with Suharto.
Brands first states why the knowledge surrounding the event is available
to the public: Lyndon B. Johnson had an ``insatiable appetite for
information,'' leading to much of the CIA's activity being
documented.(CITE) After the Bay of Pigs invasion, the CIA was put on a
far shorter leash. The documents on Indonesia later got revealed to the
public when they came up for review in the Watergate scandal. Brands
then goes on to describe America's dealings with Sukarno. The CIA
continually prodded the Indonesian army to move against Sukarno, and
after many months, ``the Johnson administration, at a loss as to what
else it might do, had basically given up.'' (CITE) The United States
then decided to try and solidify relations with Sukarno, repeatedly
meeting and offering aid. Every time, Sukarno would send ``the Americans
home empty-handed.'' (cite). Giving up again, the United States
attempted to resolve conflict in the Indonesian-Malaysian crisis and
give aid only to keep Sukarno from --- as Dean Rusk the Secretary of
State at the time put it --- ``behaving even more badly than he
has.''(cite). After repeated failure, the United States almost entirely
withdrew from Indonesia. Ellsworth Bunker, a top diplomat reported to
Washington that ``Indonesia essentially will have to save itself.''

Brands concludes with his thoughts on covert operations as a whole. He
acknowledges the credibility of America's involvement, stating that the
whole event would be ``a nonstory except that the myth of American
responsibility has proved so hardy.'' (cite). By trying to get closer to
the truth, Brands hopes to dispel rumors surrounding the event, as
``each actual operation discovered gives rise to a hundred imagined.''
(cite). Listing the many deficits of covert operations, Brands claims
that the ``most serious deficiency of covert warfare'' is its
``inevitable tendency to poison the well of public opinion.''(cite).
Rumors of covert operations, in the minds of the public, are nearly
impossible to remove --- damaging the United States. Brands ends by
stating: ``while the United States government remains in the business of
covert warfare, the list of indictments will continue to grow.''

Brands grapples with the truly global nature of the Cold War by
exploring where the Cold war is not. Even in a scenario where the United
States did not meddle, it is still perceived as the puppet master
orchestrating major changes. The extent of the Cold War reaches farther
than reality --- the Cold War was so truly global that it is now assumed
to be the cause of major events like the ones Brands discusses.
