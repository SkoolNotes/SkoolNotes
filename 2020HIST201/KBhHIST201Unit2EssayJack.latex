~In the end, did the European balance of power succeed in its goal to,
as Kissinger puts it, limit conflict and produce the ``best possible
outcome'' from flawed human nature?~Or did it magnify conflict and
increase the likelihood of global war?

\#\# Quotable Quotes

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Kissinger

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``If the circumstances were reversed, we could equally be pro-German
    and anti-French.'' A1
  \item
    ``William was perfectly willing to negotiate with Louis XIV when he
    felt the balance of power could best be served by doing so.'' A2
  \item
    ``Agreeing on the importance of the balance of power did not,
    however, still British disputes about the best strategy to implement
    the policy. \ldots{} The Whigs argued that GB should engage only
    when balance threatened, and only long enough to remove threat;
    Tories argued that GB's duty was to \emph{shape} the balance of
    power.'' A3
  \item
    CLAIM: ``Of course, in the end a balance of power always comes about
    de facto when several states interact.'' A4
  \item
    ``Power is too difficult to assess, and the willingness to vindicate
    it too various, to permit treating it as a reliable guide to
    international order. \ldots{} The balance of power inhibits the
    capacity to overthrow the international order'' A5
  \item
    ``Every king consoled himself with the thought that strengthening
    his own rule was the greatest possible contribution to the general
    peace, and left it to the ubiquitous invisible hand to justify his
    exertions - without limiting his ambitions.'' A6
  \item
    ``But Louis XN gained no peace. of mind from security; he saw in it
    an opportunity for conquest. In his overzealous pursuit of raison
    d'etat, LouisXN alarmed the rest of Europe and brought together an
    anti-French coalition which, in the end, thwarted his design.'' A7
  \item
    ``Thereby, France lost the advantage of having adversaries
    constrained by moral considerations \ldots{} Once all states played
    by the same rules, gains became much more difficult to achieve'' A8
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Roberts

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``In the next four centuries, Christianity was often to have
    disastrous effects. Confident in the possession of the true
    religion, Europeans were impatient and contemptuous of the values
    and achievements of the peoples and civilizations they disturbed.''
    A9
  \item
    ``Greed quickly led to the abuse of power, to domination and
    exploitation by force. In the end this led to great crimes - though
    they were often committed unconsciously.'' A10
  \item
    ``Europeans could usually exact what they wanted in the end because
    of a technical superiority which exaggerated the power of their tiny
    numbers and for a few centuries turned the balance against the great
    historic agglomerations of population and civilization.'' A11
  \item
    ``The obscuring of the Company's primary commercial role was not
    good for business. It also gave its employees even greater
    opportunities to feather their own nests. \ldots{} the British
    government hoped as fervently as the Company to avoid being dragged
    any further into the role of imperial power in India.'' A12
  \item
    ``The huge and growing Caribbean market for slaves and imported
    European goods was added to that already offered by a Spanish empire
    increasingly unable to defend its economic monopoly. This fixed the
    role of the West Indies in the relationships of the European powers
    for the next century. \ldots{} They were long a prey to disorder''
    A13
  \item
    ``Gradually, the great powers fought out their disputes until they
    arrived at acceptable agreements, but this was to take a long
    time.'' A14
  \item
    ``All the colonial powers had, by the eighteenth century, been able
    to extract some economic profit from their colonies'' A15
  \item
    ``Europeans did not just conquer; they exterminated local cultures
    and peoples and replaced them with their own'' A16
  \item
    ``Older cultures were to be cut off from populating the new worlds
    or setting their mark on them'' A17
  \item
    ``The French were Great Britain's most dangerous potential
    competitors, but their government was always likely to be distracted
    by its European continental commitments.'' A18
  \item
    ``The British lacked missionary zeal \ldots{} they had no immediate
    urge to interfere with the native custom or institution'' A19
  \item
    ``Before its outbreak, there had in fact been no remission of
    fighting in India, even while France and Great Britain were
    officially at peace after 1748.'' A20
  \item
    ``The possession of a station at Calcutta placed them at the door to
    that part of India which was potentially the richest prize - Bengal
    and the lower Ganges valley.'' A21
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Mason

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``A long struggle between Parliament and the Stuart kings {[}in
    England?{]} and essentially replaced the absolute monarchy with a
    constitutional monarchy'' A22
  \item
    ``\,`Sovereign power resides in my person alone \ldots. It is from
    me alone that my policies take their existence and their
    authority'\,'' A23
  \item
    ``European monarchies had consciously pursued a policy of the
    balance of power, a system of shifting international alliances that
    prevented any one country from becoming too powerful'' A24
  \item
    ``Wars were fought not so much for ideology or nationalism but to
    maintain the balance of power \ldots{} The victor did not want to
    crush the vanquished'' A25
  \item
    ``Napoleon formed mass armies and led them into other countries to
    spread the ideas of the Revolution and to enhance his own power''
    A26
  \item
    ``The French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars had unleashed forces
    that would shake the foundations of European society.'' A27
  \item
    ``Napoleon had changed the nature of warfare in Europe by
    conscripting huge armies and infusing them with a commitment to
    fight for France and for `liberty, equality, and fraternity,' the
    slogan of the Revolution.'' A28
  \item
    ``The victor did not want to crush the vanquished, as this would
    upset the balance; in any case, the defeated state might be a future
    ally.'' A29
  \item
    ``Louis XVIII issued a constitutional charter that incorporated many
    of the changes that had entered into French life and society since
    1789'' A30
  \item
    ``An inefficient system of taxation made it difficult for the
    monarchy to raise the money it needed. \ldots{} Between 1726 and
    1789, the cost of living increased by 62 percent, whereas wages rose
    by only 25 percent.'' A31
  \item
    ``Napoleon's military fortunes began to wane \ldots{} The allied
    armies pressed on, entered Paris, and forced Napoleon to abdicate''
    A32
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Our Surprise Friend Kennedy

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Europe had always been politically fragmented, despite even the best
    efforts of the Romans A33 =\textgreater{} Europe is politically
    fragmented
  \item
    For this political diversity Europe had largely to thank its
    geography. There were no enormous plains over which an empire of
    horse men could impose its swift dominion; nor were there broad and
    fertile zones \ldots{} providing the food for masses of toiling and
    easily conquerable peasants A34 =\textgreater{} Europe is A33
    because of its unique geography
  \item
    The fact was that in Europe there were always some princes and local
    lords willing to tolerate merchants and their ways even when others
    plundered and expelled them A35 =\textgreater{} Europe had mixed
    variety of local ideals that often conflicted with each other
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Trauttmann, another big surprise

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The Company had in fact aimed at territorial dominion, following the
    Dutch mode A36 =\textgreater{} In India, England (the Mediator!)
    elected to control land instead of doing balance-of-power
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Balance of power only encourages fighting when provoked

\subsection{Claim Synthesis}\label{claim-synthesis}}

\emph{Although the European balance of power does lead to frequent
competitive conflict --- like that between France and England --- it
ultimately is both naturally unavoidable and the best outcome for
generally peaceful international policy}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To BOP, constant adjustments must be made, and they often involve
  conflict

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We got to our current Euro-centric world b/c European nations,
    through leveraging its technical superiority, upset the balance of
    power in acient countries A11
  \item
    They did they b/c our good friend Raison de etat. Every king
    believes that acting in his self intrest strengthened general peace
    A6, but greed lead to unconcious crimes A10
  \item
    Indeed, too many countries Raisoning may lead to countries
    unrestrained by morality A8 to achieve the bestest they could
  \item
    But to actually achieve ``the best'', we need to constantly adjust
    the balance:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Before the 7 years war, Britian and France still fought even
      nominally at peace A20
    \item
      all the colonial powers had, by the eighteenth century, been able
      to extract some economic profit from their colonies A15
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  These small adjustments are, although potentially brutal, completely
  necessary

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    No agreement? Fight! Eventually there will be one. A14
  \item
    Because europeans intentionally set up goverment to prevent one from
    being too powerful A24
  \item
    What adjustments? Tracing Napolean:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      France was baaad: A31
    \item
      The Enlightment happpened (need quote?) Which seeks to BOP

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        French Rev shaked europe A27
      \item
        napolean tried to spread ideas of the revolution A26
      \item
        How did he fade? He got balance-of-powered A32 again b/c he was
        being too good at this emperor-not-an-emperor thing.
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      Net positive? Hard to tell. But! At that time, this was natural
      and inevitable: we got from Louis to Louis, but it is from A31
      Louis to A30 better Louis
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    A33 Europe has always been geographically fragmented, so one has to
    keep fighting to maintain balance
  \end{itemize}
\item
  BOP is heavily Euro-centric, and won't work elseware

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    When the same countries were fighting in European and foreign wars,
    they would much rather do it in Europe

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Competition in French and English colony in India often set aside
      for mainland competition A18, why? because of colonized land
      having A34 unique and large resources that make them easier to
      conqure
    \item
      A35: in Europe, no unified ideas and hence constant fighting, but
      not in conquered places, which were mostly (and easily) controlled
      by one group (Mughals, India. Ming/Qing, China)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    The big-BOP Britons did not want to assimilate in the Indeas A19
    when it is not in their intrests =\textgreater{} Raison de etat does
    not mean conflict! Just means conflict in European context

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      In India, England (the Mediator!) elected to control land instead
      of doing balance-of-power: A36
