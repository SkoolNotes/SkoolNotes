~In the end, did the European balance of power succeed in its goal to,
as Kissinger puts it, limit conflict and produce the ``best possible
outcome'' from flawed human nature?~Or did it magnify conflict and
increase the likelihood of global war?

\#\# Quotable Quotes * Kissinger * ``If the circumstances were reversed,
we could equally be pro-German and anti-French.'' A1 * ``William was
perfectly willing to negotiate with Louis XIV when he felt the balance
of power could best be served by doing so.'' A2 * ``Agreeing on the
importance of the balance of power did not, however, still British
disputes about the best strategy to implement the policy. \ldots{} The
Whigs argued that GB should engage only when balance threatened, and
only long enough to remove threat; Tories argued that GB's duty was to
\emph{shape} the balance of power.'' A3 * CLAIM: ``Of course, in the end
a balance of power always comes about de facto when several states
interact.'' A4 * ``Power is too difficult to assess, and the willingness
to vindicate it too various, to permit treating it as a reliable guide
to international order. \ldots{} The balance of power inhibits the
capacity to overthrow the international order'' A5 * ``Every king
consoled himself with the thought that strengthening his own rule was
the greatest possible contribution to the general peace, and left it to
the ubiquitous invisible hand to justify his exertions - without
limiting his ambitions.'' A6 * ``But Louis XN gained no peace. of mind
from security; he saw in it an opportunity for conquest. In his
overzealous pursuit of raison d'etat, LouisXN alarmed the rest of Europe
and brought together an anti-French coalition which, in the end,
thwarted his design.'' A7 * ``Thereby, France lost the advantage of
having adversaries constrained by moral considerations \ldots{} Once all
states played by the same rules, gains became much more difficult to
achieve'' A8 * Roberts * ``In the next four centuries, Christianity was
often to have disastrous effects. Confident in the possession of the
true religion, Europeans were impatient and contemptuous of the values
and achievements of the peoples and civilizations they disturbed.'' A9 *
``Greed quickly led to the abuse of power, to domination and
exploitation by force. In the end this led to great crimes - though they
were often committed unconsciously.'' A10 * ``Europeans could usually
exact what they wanted in the end because of a technical superiority
which exaggerated the power of their tiny numbers and for a few
centuries turned the balance against the great historic agglomerations
of population and civilization.'' A11 * ``The obscuring of the Company's
primary commercial role was not good for business. It also gave its
employees even greater opportunities to feather their own nests.
\ldots{} the British government hoped as fervently as the Company to
avoid being dragged any further into the role of imperial power in
India.'' A12 * ``The huge and growing Caribbean market for slaves and
imported European goods was added to that already offered by a Spanish
empire increasingly unable to defend its economic monopoly. This fixed
the role of the West Indies in the relationships of the European powers
for the next century. \ldots{} They were long a prey to disorder'' A13 *
``Gradually, the great powers fought out their disputes until they
arrived at acceptable agreements, but this was to take a long time.''
A14 * ``All the colonial powers had, by the eighteenth century, been
able to extract some economic profit from their colonies'' A15 *
``Europeans did not just conquer; they exterminated local cultures and
peoples and replaced them with their own'' A16 * ``Older cultures were
to be cut off from populating the new worlds or setting their mark on
them'' A17 * ``The French were Great Britain's most dangerous potential
competitors, but their government was always likely to be distracted by
its European continental commitments.'' A18 * ``The British lacked
missionary zeal \ldots{} they had no immediate urge to interfere with
the native custom or institution'' A19 * ``Before its outbreak, there
had in fact been no remission of fighting in India, even while France
and Great Britain were officially at peace after 1748.'' A20 * ``The
possession of a station at Calcutta placed them at the door to that part
of India which was potentially the richest prize - Bengal and the lower
Ganges valley.'' A21 * Mason * ``A long struggle between Parliament and
the Stuart kings {[}in England?{]} and essentially replaced the absolute
monarchy with a constitutional monarchy'' A22 * ``\,`Sovereign power
resides in my person alone \ldots. It is from me alone that my policies
take their existence and their authority'\,'' A23 * ``European
monarchies had consciously pursued a policy of the balance of power, a
system of shifting international alliances that prevented any one
country from becoming too powerful'' A24 * ``Wars were fought not so
much for ideology or nationalism but to maintain the balance of power
\ldots{} The victor did not want to crush the vanquished'' A25 *
``Napoleon formed mass armies and led them into other countries to
spread the ideas of the Revolution and to enhance his own power'' A26 *
``The French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars had unleashed forces
that would shake the foundations of European society.'' A27 * ``Napoleon
had changed the nature of warfare in Europe by conscripting huge armies
and infusing them with a commitment to fight for France and for
`liberty, equality, and fraternity,' the slogan of the Revolution.'' A28
* ``The victor did not want to crush the vanquished, as this would upset
the balance; in any case, the defeated state might be a future ally.''
A29 * ``Louis XVIII issued a constitutional charter that incorporated
many of the changes that had entered into French life and society since
1789'' A30 * ``An inefficient system of taxation made it difficult for
the monarchy to raise the money it needed. \ldots{} Between 1726 and
1789, the cost of living increased by 62 percent, whereas wages rose by
only 25 percent.'' A31

\subsection{Claim Synthesis}\label{claim-synthesis}}

\emph{Although the European balance of power does lead to frequent
competitive conflict --- like that between France and England --- it
ultimately is both naturally unavoidable and the best outcome for
generally peaceful international policy}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To BOP, constant adjustments must be made, and they often involve
  conflict

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We got to our current Euro-centric world b/c European nations,
    through leveraging its technical superiority, upset the balance of
    power in acient countries A11
  \item
    They did they b/c our good friend Raison de etat. Every king
    believes that acting in his self intrest strengthened general peace
    A6, but greed lead to unconcious crimes A10
  \item
    Indeed, too many countries Raisoning may lead to countries
    unrestrained by morality A8 to achieve the bestest they could
  \item
    But to actually achieve ``the best'', we need to constantly adjust
    the balance:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Before the 7 years war, Britian and France still fought even
      nominally at peace A20
    \item
      all the colonial powers had, by the eighteenth century, been able
      to extract some economic profit from their colonies A15 (FIND
      QUOTE: ``quite brutally''?)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  These small adjustments are, although potentially brutal, completely
  necessary

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    No agreement? Fight! Eventually there will be one. A14
  \item
    Because europeans intentionally set up goverment to prevent one from
    being too powerful A24
  \item
    What adjustments? Tracing Napolean:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      France was baaad: A31
    \item
      The Enlightment happpened (need quote?) Which seeks to BOP

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        French Rev shaked europe A27
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      napolean tried to spread ideas of the revolution A26
    \item
      How did he fade? (FIND QUOTE: ``He got balance-of-powered'' This
      is in mason. Search for the word ``banished'')
    \item
      Net positive? Hard to tell. But! At that time, this was natural
      and inevitable: we got from Louis to Louis, but it is from A31
      Louis to A30 better Louis
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  This whole sherade is the best possible outcome anyways

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Its advantageous to do business instead of doing brute
    territorialism A12, which BOP prevents (sharing! balance! best
    interest!)

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      The big-BOP Britons did not want to assimilate in the Indeas A19
      when it is not in their intrests
    \item
      Good outcome for future collab: when interest is served, working
      with adversary is possible A2. Did not want to crush enemy in
      hopes of not hurting future collab A29.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    power in itself can't be used to gauge international order, but bop
    inhibits capacity to overthrow intl order A5
