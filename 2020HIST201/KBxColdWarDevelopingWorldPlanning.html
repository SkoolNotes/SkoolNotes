            <p>September, 1957: Eisenhower gives the command, and the CIA begins planning its coup to overthrow Sukarno. 1958, it fails, forcing Sukarno into greater reliance on the PKI — the Communist party of Indonesia. Sukarno gives his famous speech, declaring loudly to the United States: “When any nation offers us aid with political strings attached, then I will tell them, go to hell with your aid!” America’s influence over Sukarno had been admitted and destroyed in one fell swoop. A year later, Sukarno becomes the first to drop out of the United Nations. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002070206502000205?journalCode=ijxa Sukarno then gives another speech, recorded by Francis Galbraith, the American embassy’s Chief of Mission. Galbraith wrote, “Sukarno declares Indonesia in the camp of the Asian Communist countries and opposed to the U.S.” He continued, “It would be fatuous to pretend that this speech is other principally than a declaration of enmity for us.” September 30, 1965: Another coup takes place, six top army generals are seized and murdered. Suharto, a far right-wing general, takes Sukarno’s power. Followed by this transfer was the massacring of Indonesian communists — and alleged communists — that left the country in shock. Body count estimates range from hundreds of thousands to over a million. The United States congratulated Suharto and supported him as he then ruled as dictator. H. W. Brands, the author of <em>The Limits of Manipulation: How the United States Didn’t Topple Sukarno</em>, claims that America had virtually no involvement, and the transfer of power from Sukarno to Suharto “resulted instead from developments of essentially Indonesian origin.”</p>
            <p>it’s importance in the Cold War.</p>
            <p>To understand the events that took place in Indonesia, one must first understand Indonesia’s surrounding context. The initial coup took place just a few years after Eisenhower’s election. One year after the election, the CIA successfully overthrew Mohammed Mossadegh, the Iranian Prime Minister at the time. Another year later, the CIA toppled Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz, replacing him with Carlos Castillo Armas who instated a military dictatorship. It was a time of covert operations and government manipulation in developing countries. The second coup, leading to the transfer of power from Sukarno to Suharto took place just at the start of the Cold War’s height. Chronologically in the middle of the Vietnam war, the United States feared Sukarno would create a similar situation to South Vietnam. {CITES!}</p>
            <p>Indonesia itself had incredible value to the United States during the cold war. It’s unique location contributed greatly to this value; Indonesia spanned the sea lanes linking the Pacific and Indian Oceans, providing a crucial choke-point. It also outflanked Vietnam, providing crucial positioning to the ongoing war. https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep05921.11?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents Complimenting its locational and strategical advantages, Indonesia was rich with natural resources. Along with an abundance of oil and natural gas, it carried a slew of valuable metals. {} https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-are-the-major-natural-resources-of-indonesia.html</p>
            <p>However, H. W. Brands argues that America had virtually no involvement with the coup that took down Sukarno and replaced him with Suharto. Brands first states why the information surrounding the event is available to the public: Lyndon B. Johnson had an “insatiable appetite for information,” leading to much of the CIA’s activity being documented.(CITE) After the Bay of Pigs invasion, the CIA was put on a far shorter leash. The documents on Indonesia later got revealed to the public when they came up for review in the Watergate scandal. Brands then goes on to describe America’s dealings with Sukarno. The CIA continually prodded the Indonesian army to move against Sukarno, and after many months, “the Johnson at a loss as to what else it might do, had basically given up.” (CITE) The United States then decided to try and solidify relations with Sukarno, repeatedly meeting and offering aid. Every time, Sukarno would send “the Americans home empty-handed.” (cite). Giving up again, the United States attempted to resolve conflict in the Indonesian-Malaysian crisis and give aid only to keep Sukarno from — as Dean Rusk the Secretary of State at the time put it — “behaving even more badly than he has.”(cite). After repeated failure, the United States almost entirely withdrew from Indonesia. Ellsworth</p>
