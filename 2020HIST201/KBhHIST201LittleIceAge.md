Global climate changes **between the 1550s-1750s** causes increased temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere. Historians call this "The Little Ice Age"

# Theories of Causes
The cause of this sudden change in weather is still unknown, but there are some theories as to how this happened…

## Maunder Minimum
* Decreased sun spots causes less sun energy output
* Hence, the earth is cooled

## Volcano
* Earlier in the period, there had been volcanic activity
* Filipino volcanoes thought to deposit smoke, in which water droplets could have cooled the earth for ~3yrs

## Slash-and-burn theory
* Native Americans had a habit of clearing — whether through burning or slashing — forestland that could be used for farming. This reduces forests, so more $CO_2$ could be in the air
* The Europeans' influence of NA habit causes less of this to happen, making it be rather more Carbon Dioxide in the air

# Resulting Effects
**DISEASE, DISEASE, DISEASE**

## In 'Murica

Malaria was rampant, meaning quite a few different things were going South. Literally.

* People who do have jobs kept dying 
* People in Europe don't really want to, ye know, show up
* So Slave market sprung 

## In China

Widespread famine because of the bad produce of China's farmland. 

* Cannibalism!
* Ming's court isn't doing much helping…
    * Rampant with infighting
    * Fighting pointless wars in the North, pretty much due to [[KBhHIST201ProblemsWithSilver]] silver problems similar to Spain. 

### Woes of the Ming Government
* American trees bringing rains
* Government being worked against by the people
* Rebels occurring at every level
