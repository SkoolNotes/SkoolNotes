# Nation-States

Idea of a "nation" is actually a new thing => "group of people with a common culture, sense of identity, and political aspirations" (no longer monarch-soverignty based).

1) Strong monarchs began creating stronger national states w/ breaking local lord power + consolidating governmental power
2) National identity fostered by the culture (artists, writers, linguists)    
	* Lit woks helped defined national groups + foster sense of identity
	* Musicians also contributed by adding elements local music into their composition
	* Dictionaries were compiled to the understanding of the local culture
3) Ethnic groups began acquiring a _common heritage_ => shapes identity => strengthens the heritage => [[KBhHIST201Nationalism]]

And boom! Nation-states. [[KBhHIST201Nationalism]]-engendered cultural states.
