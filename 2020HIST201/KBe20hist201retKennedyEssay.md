Essay 1: Kennedy and Mann on Ming Decline

 

Directions: In Chapter 1 of Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, Paul Kennedy sketches out an explanation of why the Ming Dynasty was, on the one hand powerful and prosperous, but ultimately was “a country which had turned in on itself” and subject to “steady relative decline.” Mann, in his chapter on the Ming trade, gives the reader a lot more detail on the nuances of Ming history in this period. Putting Kennedy and Mann into dialogue, does Kennedy’s argument still hold up? In your essay, argue for or against Kennedy’s argument using the details of Ming history analyzed by Mann.

 

A strong essay will clearly describe Kennedy’s argument and link it to specific pieces of supporting or challenging evidence from Mann.   

 

Additional sources: In addition to Kennedy and Mann, you may OPTIONALLY use and cite from any of the primary sources below, as well as the more extensive versions in the Drive. This will give you a chance to demonstrate the “exemplary” level of the Use of Evidence standard (which requires a “diverse variety of sources”), but is not required for any other standard. When using these sources, keep their authorship and context in mind. 


Citations: Direct quotations as well as paraphrasing from any of the sources should be cited with a simple footnote citation with author and page number (if available). Such as: (Kennedy 23) or (Chelebi).

Length: 350-750 words

Format: 12 pt font, double spaced, double-sided if possible, with name on at least the first page.

 

Wang Xijue, Ming dynasty court official, report to the emperor, 1593.

The venerable elders of my home district explain that the reason grain is cheap despite poor harvests in recent years is due entirely to the scarcity of silver coin.  The national government requires silver for taxes but disburses little silver in its expenditures.  As the price of grain falls, tillers of the soil receive lower returns on their labors, and thus less land is put into cultivation.

 

Huang Zongxi, late Ming dynasty scholar who fought against eunuch rule of the court and the Manchu invasion, writes about the need for a prime minister in “Waiting for the Dawn”, after the Manchu conquest in 1662.

The origin of misrule under the Ming lay in the abolition of the prime ministership by [the Ming founder] Gao Huangdi. […] It may be argued that in recent times matters of state have been discussed in cabinet, which actually amounted to having prime ministers, even though nominally there were no prime ministers.  But this is not so.  The job of those who handled matters in the cabinet has been to draft comments of approval and disapproval just like court clerks. […] 

I believe that those with the actual power of prime ministers today are the palace menials [eunuchs]. Final authority always rests with someone, and the palace menials, seeing the executive functions of the prime minister fall to the ground, undischarged by anyone, have seized the opportunity to establish numerous regulations, extend the scope of their control, and take over from the prime minister the power of life and death.

 

Zhang Han (1510-1593), was a Ming official who writes Songchuang Meng Yu (松窗夢語) during his retirement.  This is from a chapter, “On Trade.”

As to the foreign trade on the northwestern frontier and the foreign sea trade in the southeast, if we compare their advantages and disadvantages with respect to our nation’s wealth and the people’s well-being, we will discover that they are as different as black and white. But those who are in charge of state economic matters know only the benefits of the Northwest trade, ignoring the benefits of the sea trade. How can they be so blind?

[Northwestern] Foreigners are recalcitrant and their greed knows no bounds. […] I do not think our present trade with them will ensure us a century of peace.

As to the foreigners in the southeast, their goods are useful to us just as ours are to them. To use what one has to exchange for what one does not have is what trade is all about. Moreover, these foreigners trade with China under the name of tributary contributions. That means China’s authority is established and the foreigners are submissive. Even if the gifts we grant them are great and the tribute they send us is small, our expense is still less than one ten-thousandth of the benefit we gain from trading with them.

 

The Salt and Iron Debates from 81 AD documented Confucian scholars’ critique of the government’s trade monopolies. This represents the traditional Confucian stance on trade.

The Confucian learned men: The purpose of merchants is circulation and the purpose of artisans is making tools. These matters should not become a major concern of the government.

At present the government ignores what people have and exacts what they lack. The common people then must sell their products cheaply to satisfy the demands of the government. […]

The government officers busy themselves with gaining control of the market and cornering commodities. With the commodities cornered, prices soar and merchants make private deals and speculate. The officers connive with the cunning merchants who are hoarding commodities against future need. Quick traders and unscrupulous officials buy when goods are cheap in order to make high profits. Where is the balance in this standard?

## Outline

### Kennedy's Argument
> There was, to be sure, a plausible strategical reason for this decision. The northern frontiers of the empire were again under some pressure from the Mongols, and it may have seemed prudent to concentrate military resources in this more vulnerable area. Under such circumstances a large navy was an expensive luxury, and in any case, the attempted Chinese expansion southward into Annam (Vietnam) was proving fruitless and costly. Yet this quite valid reasoning does not appear to have been reconsidered when the disadvantages of naval retrenchment later became clear: within a century or so, the Chinese coastline and even cities on the Yangtze were being attacked by Japanese pirates, but there was no serious rebuilding of an imperial navy. Even the repeated appearance of Portuguese vessels off the China coast did not force a reassessment. Defense on land was all that was required, the mandarins reasoned, for had not all maritime trade by Chinese subjects been forbidden in any case?
> Apart from the costs and other disincentives involved, therefore, a key element in China's retreat was the sheer conservatism of the Confucian bureaucracy—a conservatism heightened in the Ming period by resentment at the changes earlier forced upon them by the Mongols. In this "Restoration" atmosphere, the all-important officialdom concerned to preserve and recapture the past, not to create a brighter future based upon overseas expansion and commerce. According to the Confucian code, warfare itself was a deplorable activity and armed forces were made necessary only by the fear of barbarian attacks or internal revolts. The mandarins' dislike of the army (and the navy) was accompanied by a suspicion of the trader. The accumulation of private capital, the practice of buying cheap and selling dear, the ostentation of the nouveau riche merchant, all offended the elite, scholarly bureaucrats—almost as much as they aroused the resentments of the toiling masses. While not wishing to bring the entire market economy to a halt, the mandarins often intervened against individual merchants by confiscating their property or banning their business. Foreign trade by Chinese subjects must have seemed even more dubious to mandarin eyes, simply because it was less under their control.
