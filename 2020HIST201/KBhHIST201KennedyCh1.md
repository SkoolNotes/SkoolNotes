# Kennedy, Chapter1 

## Situations with Europe, pre 1500
> 1500, the date chosen … to mark the divide between modern and pre-modern times.

See [[KBhHIST201EuropeOnTheBrink]]
   
## The Early Global Players
Although it was not evident to see Europe's boom in the 1500 in, well, the 1500, there were definitely great centres of tho world at the time.

> Before investigating the causes of [European] rise, it is necessary to examine the strengths and the weaknesses of the other contenders.

### Ming China

ADVANCED in tech. ADVANCED in structure. SUPERIOR in culture: Ming China was extremely technologically advanced and culturally strong. It was the biggest state + economy in Asia.

See [[KBhHIST201MingChina1500]]

### The Ottomans

 When China was failing, the Ottomans grow w/ Muslimdom — Ottomans were the largest muslim nation in Europe + a serious threat to Christendom.
 
See [[KBhHIST201Ottomans1500]] 

## The Europeans' Rise

#disorganized

Guiding question: so, how did scattered Europeans become the number 1 world player from futal tribes?

* Europe is politically fragmented, but Mr. Kennedy thinks this is mucho bueno
    * Causes
        * Geographical — no big plains but lots of rivers
        * Harsher climate makes difficult central control
    * Effects
        * Hard to be fully unified, and hence hard to be assimilated
        * Diversity encouraged inter-dependence and trade (which, #why is this a good thing necessarily?)
            * Trade included _bulk_ items primarily and not luxury-focused trade of the east
            * Easy access to sea encouraged shipbuilding
            * Quick, common day trade encouraged building on an economy — credit, banks, common currency
            * Need for long-range fishing encourages the building of bigger ships, and that's good because #why?
* Advantages of political fragmentation
    * Economic development could not have been suppressed #why
    * No central authority made trading and merchants less stigmatized (although they are, like in strict Confuciansim (see [[KBhHIST201ChinasDecline1500]] China's Govermental Decline in the 1500s) , disliked)
    * 

## Why Kennedy is Frustrating
Kennedy's arguments is very frustrating.

His arguments are not very well supported. For instance, his argument that orthodox Confucianism stopped trade (and ???, then) decline for China. 

Missing was pieces of evidence could have caused tremendous difficulty.

> "I don't need arguments to support his claims, I just need to claim harder" — Kennedy

* "These people failed because they cared about their own people" — Both Empires
* "These people failed because they used a strategy that have worked for them and is working" — Ming w.r.t. Confusianism
* "These people failed because they are too good and managing an empire" — Ottomans w.r.t. to the Romanitus
