Paul Kennedy's \textit{The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers} presents a
theory in which he proposed that Europe's model of small nation-states
helped encourage competition and diversification that prevents
governmental overextension and domination that, according to Kennedy,
leads to eventual downfall. In proving his overall thesis, Kennedy made
a claim addressing the reason why China closed its maritime trade after
the 1433 expedition of Zheng He --- claiming that a conservative
following of Confucian principles and effective governmental obstinance
in Ming China's part lead to their eventual downfall in trade. In an
attempt to justify his arguments, Kennedy cited a lack of
\texttt{reconsideration\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\ in\ rebuilding\ trade\ and\ naval\ forces\ even\ when,\ according\ to\ his\ work,\ circumstances\ became\ clear\ to\ rebuild\ trade;\ he\ alleges\ that,\ instead\ of\ economic\ or\ domestic\ incentives,\ the\ Ming\ government\ refused\ to\ reopen\ due\ to\ its}conservative
Confucian'\,' nature. In Kennedy's claim arguing that the conservative
Confucian views caused Ming's closing of maritime trade, he presents a
faulty argument that ignores both the ineffectiveness of unnecessarily
reopening maritime trade and the discord in the infighting-plagued Ming
government; through his argument, Kennedy also misinterpreted Confucian
philosophy central to his argument for it, instead of an ideological ban
on trade, actually favors market circulation and advises governments not
to encourage price racketeering.

One main flaw in Kennedy's argument of the conservative Confucian cause
of the closing of maritime trade lies in the work's lack of
consideration to longer-term effects of reopening maritime trade under
the Ming's situation. In his argument, Kennedy claims that stopping
maritime activity
\texttt{does\ not\ appear\ to\ have\ been\ reconsidered\ when\ the\ disadvantanges\ ...\ became\ clear:\ ...\ the\ Chinese\ coastline\ and\ even\ cities\ ...\ were\ being\ attacked\ by\ Japanese\ pirates\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\ -\/-\/-\ implying\ that\ there\ must\ be\ an\ alterer\ motive\ in\ not\ resuming\ maritime\ activity\ even\ in\ a\ situation\ that,\ hints\ Kennedy,\ is\ in\ dire\ need\ of\ redecision.\ Center\ to\ the\ this\ claim,\ however,\ is\ the\ notion\ that\ while\ there\ be\ no\ reason\ not\ to\ reopen\ trade,\ Ming\ China\ failed\ to\ do\ so.\ Unsurprisingly,\ this\ is\ untrue:\ after\ some\ political\ struggle,\ China\ in\ fact\ \textbackslash{}textit\{did\}\ attempt\ an\ reopening\ of\ trade\ that,\ contrary\ to\ what\ Kennedy\ hints\ in\ his\ argument,\ did\ not\ rapidly\ resolve\ the\ economic\ situation\ in\ Ming\ china\ in\ both\ short\ and\ long\ term.\ As\ Kennedy\ mentioned,\ the\ closing\ of\ trade\ and\ subsequent\ deflation\ lead\ to\ rapid\ merchant\ attacks\ on\ coastal\ China\ -\/-\/-\ especially\ in\ the\ coastal,\ trade-dependent\ region\ of\ Fujian.\ Yet,\ contrary\ to\ what\ Kennedy\ presented,\ the\ Ming\ government\ indeed}reversed
course {[}on trade{]}'`, invalidating Kennedy's initial argument.
Kennedy failed to recognize the actual broader implications of simple
trade reopening that, indeed, actually lead to why China's economy
ultimately imploded. The Ming government reopened trade
\texttt{not\ only\ because\ it\ recognized\ its\ inability\ to\ stop\ smuggling,\ or\ because\ it\ had\ begun\ to\ appreciate\ how\ much\ Fujian\textquotesingle{}s\ populace\ depended\ on\ trade.\ Beijing\ had\ come\ to\ realize\ that\ the\ nation\ desperately\ needed\ the\ merchants\textquotesingle{}\ most\ important\ good:\ silver.\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\ Silver,\ due\ to\ its\ relative\ stability,\ was\ a\ major\ asset\ at\ the\ time\ to\ the\ Ming\ government\ due\ to\ the\ disastrous\ hyperinflation/deflation\ cycles\ caused\ by\ repeated\ issuing\ of\ novel\ coins\ by\ each\ Emperor.\ Although\ this\ initial\ reopening\ of\ a\ silver-based\ economy\ proved\ to\ be\ reasonably\ successful\ in\ the\ short\ run,\ the\ Spanish\ discovery\ of\ the\ Potos√≠\ mine\ would\ actually\ ignite\ the\ broader\ economic\ downfall\ that\ Kennedy\ appears\ to\ associate\ with\ a\ simple\ ban\ on\ trade:}In
1642, so much silver has been produced that its value is falling even as
the mines slacken \ldots{} Like the Spanish king, the Ming emperor backs
his military ventures with Spanish silver, which his subjects must use
to pay their taxes. When the value of silver falls, the government runs
out of money.'' Contrary to Kennedy's claims, the Ming economy did not
fail due to a supposed lack of ``reconsideration'\,' on trade; it did
reconsider trading quite extensively, and instead imploded centuries
later due to a worldwide deflation caused by an influx of Spanish
silver.

Through his argument, Kennedy did --- in fact --- acknowledge one reason
that he claimed is a
\texttt{plausible\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\ reason\ for\ a\ closing\ of\ trade:\ the\ Mongols.\ Kennedy\ claims\ that\ maintaining}a
large navy was an expensive luxury.'\,' But, immediately following that
claim, Kennedy follows up with a seemingly contradicting statement
calling the Ming government to
\texttt{reconsider\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\ their\ anti-maritime\ decision\ due\ to\ the\ Japanese\ attacks\ aforementioned.\ Through\ this,\ Kennedy\ not\ only\ blindsided\ his\ own\ argument,\ but\ created\ another\ flaw\ in\ his\ argument\ by\ ignoring\ the\ longstanding\ political\ struggle\ for\ which\ the\ Mongolian\ attacks\ are,\ in\ fact,\ a\ scapegoat.\ Zheng\ He\textquotesingle{}s\ voyages}had
become a target in political infighting --- one bureaucratic faction
championing them, \ldots{} {[}and{]} another trying to take down the
first by decrying their expense.'\,' With two bureaucratic factions
championing opposing causes --- sacrificing Zheng He as a means to an
end --- it is not surprising that one of the two would take an obvious
and understandable cause of the Mongols as an argument against the
expeditions through
\texttt{decrying\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\ the\ expense.\ The\ cancellation\ of\ the\ voyages\ by\ Yongle\textquotesingle{}s\ son\ is,\ simply,\ a\ show\ of\ strength\ to\ the\ other}faction'`:
power consolidation masqueraded as sensible economic policy. The Mongol
attacks, cited by those opposing Zheng He's voyages as economic
luxuriation, were in fact a perennial problem: the Ming was given
Mandate after overturning
\texttt{the\ Mongol-lead\ Yuan\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{},\ was\ -\/-\/-\ as\ Kennedy\ correctly\ noted\ -\/-\/-\ attacked\ (CITENEEDED)\ by\ Mongol\ invasions\ through\ its\ rule,\ and\ indeed\ was\ later\ overturned\ by\ the\ Manchus}who
had taken north \ldots{} {[}since{]} during Song times'`. Attacks of
China from the north were constant and rampant, making it less than
evident that an elevation would cause China to destroy such a large
naval investment. Although there may exist many theories hypothesizing
the reason why the naval forces are destroyed --- infighting chief among
which --- the attacks from the North are more common then Kennedy
claimed it to be: not periodic and acute enough to warrant the
destruction of such vast naval forces and an subsequent
``reconsideration'' afterwards as Kennedy had claimed.

Center to Kennedy's argument is his claim that the
\texttt{sheer\ conservatism\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\ in\ Ming\textquotesingle{}s\ Confucian\ government\ brought\ the\ downfall\ to\ expeditions\ of\ Zheng\ He\ -\/-\/-\ a\ claim\ that\ both\ egregiously\ misinterpreted\ the\ Confucian\ viewpoint\ on\ trade\ and\ paints\ an\ unfair\ caricature\ of\ the\ Ming\ government.}In
{[}the Ming's{]} `Restoration' atmosphere,'\,' claims Kennedy,
\texttt{the\ all-important\ officialdom\ was\ concerned\ to\ preserve\ and\ recapture\ the\ past,\ not\ to\ create\ a\ brighter\ future.\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\ In\ this\ argument,\ Kennedy\ hints\ that\ a\ preservation\ of\ the}past'\,'
--- whichever model of the past that may be --- would necessarily bring
not only a full, unmitigated dismissal of present technologies, but also
a unexplainable dismissal of any possibility of improvement. If, per
Kennedy's claims, the
\texttt{sheer\ ...\ Confucian\ bureaucracy\ ...\ {[}was{]}\ a\ key\ element\ in\ China\textquotesingle{}s\ retreat\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\ from\ all\ trade\ activities,\ then\ the\ conservative\ past\ that\ Kennedy\ claims\ China\ is\ emulating\ would\ need\ a\ stance\ greatly\ antagonistic\ to\ trade\ to\ warrant\ a\ full}destruction
of all sea-going vessels'\,' (CITENEEDED) and dramatic shutdown.
However, the views of the Confucian scholars in the 81 AD Han Salt and
Iron Debate disagrees:
\texttt{the\ purpose\ of\ merchants\ is\ circulation\ and\ the\ purpose\ of\ artisans\ is\ making\ tools.\ These\ matters\ should\ not\ become\ a\ major\ concern\ of\ the\ government.\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\ Through\ his\ claim,\ Kennedy\ candidly\ misinterpreted\ the\ Confucian\ viewpoint.\ Instead\ of\ a\ complete\ shutdown\ of\ trade,\ Confucian\ scholars\ claim\ that\ a\ well-ran\ government\ should\ not\ be\ \textbackslash{}textit\{concerned\}\ with\ controlling\ trade\ themselves\ -\/-\/-\ natural\ trade\ (i.e.\ creation\ and\ circulation),\ not\ monopolies\ and\ limits,\ should\ be\ encouraged.\ The\ Confucian\ view\ against\ merchants\ is\ not\ one\ that\ forbids\ their\ existence,\ but\ a\ view\ where}quick
traders and unscrupulous officials {[}that{]} buy when goods are cheat
to make high profits'\,' --- in other words, arbitraging and
racketeering --- is discouraged. Through the Salt and Iron debates,
Confucian scholars are trying to convince a struggling Han dynasty from
imposing a strict trade limitation. The traditional Confucian views that
Kennedy claim Ming China is desperately attempting to emulate in fact
does not correlate with the Ming government's action of limitation,
rendering Kennedy's claims invalid.

In Kennedy's claim that traditional Confucian views brought the Ming
government to stop all maritime trade, the author presents a problematic
claim that not only ignores both the ineffectiveness of trade opening
and the discord in the Ming leadership but also misinterpreted Confucian
philosophy central to his argument. Kennedy, through his faulty and
somewhat forced argumentation, applies a simplification to the rich and
nuanced Ming governmental system that simply is not warranted. Although
this calls for a reevaluation of his comparative analysis between
European and Oriental cultures in terms of competition, Kennedy's
primary arguments surrounding Europe in itself remains valid.
