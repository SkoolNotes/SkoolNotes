## Inspiring Raison de' Etat

30 Years' War => The reason why deRichlieu instituted Raison d'etat.

* France was surrounded by HRE
* All others loyal to HRE  
* Hence, the Cardinal disregarded the fact that he is the Cardinal, and instituted this idea => State > Religion to team up + fight
* Sided with the Protestants 

  > Had the Habsburg emperors played according to the same rules or understood the emerging world of _raison d'etat,_ they would have seen how well placed they were to achieve what Richelieu feared most-the pre-eminence of Austria and the emergence of the Holy Roman Empire as the dominant power on the Continent  -- [[KBhHIST201Kissinger]]
