Although the first world war was "indeed a victory for democracy,"
neither the victors nor the aftermath promoted widespread liberty.

Although originally induced by the security dilemma, the rapid military
expansion was often exaggerated by political and egotistical
motivations: the British government's naval ambitions were not strictly
defensive. The English public had been historically isolationist and did
not want to join the war. However, the British government saw Kaiser's
Kruger Telegram of 1896 and Germany's naval expansion as politically
insulting. As tensions increased and militaries were expanded, public
sentiment shifted to be more nationalist (Huang, The Inevitable Shift).
This engineered public sentiment was quickly reversed when the bloody
trench stalemate became apparent, but the war torn countries felt they
needed to outlast the enemy as a point of pride. The wage slavery and
proletariat oppression of Marx, Engels, and Lenin came in the form of
state propaganda posters imploring women to work in factories and
conserve bread (Khakpour, WWI Aftermath, 5). English war poet Charles
Sorley writes of the "millions of the mouthless dead," exposing the loss
of life on the battlefield. The English masses had not been thrust into
the war for the common good or the liberty of the citizens---Britain
entered the war because it's leadership had been insulted by German
industrialization. In the process, the Entente powers amassed massive
debts to the United States which their citizens would have to suffer in
the coming years. The Entente war effort led to democratic victories,
but did not promote the liberty of their citizens.

The new and democratic German republic, who professed their own ideals,
did not feel responsible or attached to the previous regime (Palmer
688). However, the treaty makers in Paris working in early 1919 under
public pressure and "still in the heat of the war" dealt harshly to
Germany---so much so that no German was willing to sign the Treaty of
Versailles (Palmer 692-3). Although the German Empire was toppled and
replaced with a more democratic government, the harsh treaty opened the
way for Adolf Hitler's authoritarian regime. Hitler's election was
indeed democratic, but his regime stripped liberty from vast
populations. Aristotle writes that democracies are the "rule of the
poor", and Hitler leveraged the hunger and anger of the poor masses to
amass power. Once in control, he quickly converted the state to a
centralized tyranny focused on his own political viewpoints---or, as
Lenin would remark, a machine to for one group to oppress another. As
Aristotle predicted, neither democratic nor tyrannical policy was
beneficial to the citizen body as a whole. This surface-level "victory"
for democracy did not lead to widespread liberty. An additional central
goal of the Paris settlement was to allow national self-determination in
Europe. The peacemakers attempted to create a sovereign nation for each
people in eastern Europe. However, the intermixing of nationalities,
lack of population exchange, and independence declarations of various
states complicated the process. As a result, each new state found alien
minorities within its borders and next of kin under foreign rule (Palmer
692). The newly-formed buffer states, including Lithuania, Latvia,
Poland, and Czechoslovakia, were generally parliamentary democracies
(Palmer 692, Latvian Institute). However, they were created to serve the
purpose of buffering Bolshevik communism from spreading to western
Europe and were thus hastily drawn, culturally torn, and politically
weak. The first Latvian president went as far as to demilitarize the
country, which was presently trampled in the second world war (Latvian
Institute). These cultural divides, which were suspiciously reminiscent
of the Slavic misrepresentations in the pre-war Austrian Empire, led to
numerous fractured states with disgruntled populations---a number of
ostensible democracies that failed to rule in the interest of their
citizens.

If there was one thing Lenin and Woodrow Wilson could agree on, it was
that the secret and unprincipled international politics of the past had
led the world into anarchy (Palmer 687-9). In January of 1918, as U-boat
attacks were more effectively countered and the tide seemed to be
turning toward an allied victory, Wilson unveiled his fourteen points
which outlined a more righteous framework for international politics
(Palmer 677, 688). At the 1819 Paris peace confrence, Wilson negotiated
heavily for one point in particular---the creation of a League of
Nations whose purpoted purpose was to subvert the international anarchy
and settle future conflicts. As a result, numerous comprimises were made
on the fourteen points. \textless\textgreater{} Starting in 1915 when
the entente powers realized the war would not be quick, Britain and
other allies, made heavy use of post-war land promises to attract
nations to their side of the battle. Such secret treaties included the
Constantinople Agreement, the Treaty of London; the Sykes-Picot
Agreement, and the Treaty of Saint Jean de Maurienne (Gelvin 186-7).
When the war was over, one central purpose of the League of Nations was
to fairly and humanitarianly divide the Ottoman empire and German
colonies; however, when congress refused to join the League, the
allocation of land and colonies under a "mandate" system was directed by
France and Britain (Palmer 690, Gelvin 189). In particular, the western
coast of the Arabian peninsula (the Levant) and the fertile center of
world trade (Mesopotemia) were to be divided into fledgling states and
brought into world of western politics (Gelvin 184). The British and
French governments took this opportunity to
