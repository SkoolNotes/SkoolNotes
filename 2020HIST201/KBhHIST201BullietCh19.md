    * [[KBhHIST201ProblemsWithSilver]] Problems with Silver 
        * Affected landowners
        * Could not build stronger millitary
        * Caused the weakening of calvalrymen + increase in reliance on POWs
    * CLAIM: "Religious laws … constrained the ottomans from reforming the tax system"
        * Levied surtaxes
        * Caused rebellions + banditry
    * POWS took advantage of influence to gain the ability to marry and do business, but overall caused deterioation of the qualitiy of the millitary (less professionals, more POWs)
* Declining government, too!
    * Sultans kept to themselves
    * Prevented male relatives from leaving the palace
    * _Females gained larger rule_ + chief administrators oversaw the actual government **important!**:  CLAIM — sterotipically, muslim culture had fears of woman in politics
    * Original systems is slowly abolished
        * Land grants for millitary services disappeared
        * Abolished devshirme system which selected POW officers
        * Tax farming became allowed
            * Tax collectors are allowed to pre-paid tax and collect any amount to recouperate
            * Caused local administration to suffer due to the above
        * Corruption within the government lead them to give power to tax collectors
            * Causing them to control the incomes and expenses of a regions
            * Which turns them into large private landowners
        * Rural disorder also caused new economic opportunities
            * CLAIM: ottoman's lack of control brings other European costal regions to resume originally Ottoman controlled trades
            * Local farmers shifted growth to cash crops (tobacco, cotton, oil, etc.)
        * The armies kept deteriorating
            * Resorted to hiring substitutes
            * Also relied partially on trained seasonal recruits 
        * Europeans took control of Ottomans' overseas trade "Capitulations" — special trade agreements
            * European domination of Ottoman seaborne trade
            * Muslim merchants are trading at a disadvantage due to this domination
        * Few Ottoman statesmen observed the change, but they are generally disregarded
