## Watson *~*
`The Evolution of International Society; a comparative, Historical Analysis`

Classification words of civilizations are not descriptive enough. Way to broad. 

Empires fall along a spectrum from  absolute independence to absolute empire. The absolutes are theoretical and do not occur in practice. 

#### Four Broad Categories:
- Independence
- Hegemony
- Dominion
- Empire



Order -> peace / prosperity,  less freedom

Rules *expected to* benefit all members of system

> commitments to a collective security

**Freedom of action in an independent states is limited by the pressures of interdependence in a system**

`Hegemony = Being able to exert a *law* above the operatings of the system`

^ Sometimes though of as only one person 

Broader: 
`Hegemony =  Being albe to determine the relations between the members of an international society`

`Suzerainty = One state hold total political power over another`

> shadowy overlord-ship 

hegemony requires tacit acceptance 

`Dominion = Imperial authoirty determines the internal government of other communities, but retain their identity as seperate states and some control over their own affairs`


`Empire = direct administration of differnt communities from an imperial centre`

==Continuum!==


Community bound by:
- custom
- ethnic descent
- religion
- language

^ the importance of these fluctuates drastically over time

#### Pendulum Theory

Hegemony on one side, dominion on the other, swings between and over corrects. 

#### Examples

- Suzerainty / Dominion? 
	- UK's control over India
	- "the thing that happened with Russia a few years ago"
	- China with Tawain? 
	- China with Hong Kong 
- Empire 
	-	Differentiate from "bloated state" with 
		-	Core + periphery 
			-	Provinces with separate rights, but not independent on paper
	-   Holy roman empire
		-   Weird mix of empire + hegemony. Like feudalism	

> Are there patterns in world history? 

Takeover -> split -> slow reforming 


#### The State 

What is a state?
> a state is a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory 

Where do states come from? 

**Social contract theory:**
> The state rises from the cumulative experience of a populations...

Basically, the need for a leader / social contract arises with size. 


**Bellicist theory:** with Charles Tilly
> war makes states and states make war


###### Four Functions of a state

> Think of the state as like the mafia

- War Making
	-	Created taxes
		-	Leads to protection
- State Making
- Protection
- Extraction 
	-	Want rich people to stay and not be dangerous
		-	Solution: Legal system 


#### Bellicist theory group work 
```
With your group, brainstorm the following:
What hypotheses might you generate from the bellicist theory of the state? (i.e. “If I change variable X in a state’s history/situation/etc. the effect will be Y”)
Using history as your data, how might you test your hypothesis?
Bonus: Can you think of any specific examples in history (regions, events, states/empires) that might be good places to look for evidence for or against the bellicist theory?
