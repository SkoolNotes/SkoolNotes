###### (war to the Ottomans is) not bureaucratic, it's an art form.

Safavid's started to copy Ottoman war tactics after they lost. They even kept a painting of a lost war in their main hall.

But couldn't take over the Mediterranean --  too many competing European forces.

> Alignment of potentially unlimited aspirations with necessarily limited capabilities
