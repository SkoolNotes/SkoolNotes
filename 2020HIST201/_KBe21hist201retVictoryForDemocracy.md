1.  \"however, Britain and France accepted the mandates so that they

    gentry, as well as the transformation of once independent
    pasturalists and farmers into tenant labor\' (gelvin 194)

3.  lenin

    1.  \'And so in capitalist society we have a democracy that is
        curtailed, wretched, false, a democracy only for the rich, for
        the minority. The dictatorship of the proletariat, the period of
        transition to communism, will for the first time create
        democracy for the people, for the majority, along with the
        necessary suppression of the exploiters, of the minority.
        Communism alone is capable of providing really complete
        democracy, and the more complete it is, the sooner it will
        become unnecessary and wither away of its own accord. \' (Lenin,
        *State and Revolution*, 1917)

    2.  \"\[The state is\] a special machine for the suppression of one
        class by another, and, what is more, of the majority by the
        minority. ... The systematic suppression of the exploited
        majority by the exploiting minority calls for the utmost
        ferocity and savagery ... slavery, serfdom and wage labor\'
        (Lenin, *State and Revolution*, 1917)

4.  aristotle

    1.  \'So it is clear that a polis is of best size when it has a
        population large enough for a self-sufficient lifestyle but one
        that can be seen at a glance.\' (From Dillon, Mathew, Lynda
        Garland. 2010. *Ancient Greece. Social and Historical Documents
        from Archaic Times to the Death of Alexander the Great.* New
        York: Routledge. Aristotle, *Politics* 1326b11)

    2.  \"aristocracy, either because the rulers are the best men, or
        because they promote the best interests of the state and
        citizens; when the many administer the state for the common
        interest, the government is called a constitutional government\"
        \"deviations from these are as follows: from kingship, tyranny
        (interests of the ruler); from aristocracy, oligarchy (interests
        of the wealthy); from constitutional government; democracy
        (interests of the poor)\" Aristotle *Politics* 1279a32, 1279b4

# outline

## intro

### As American historian Robert Roswell Palmer concludes in his chapter on the first world war, \"the war was indeed a victory for democracy\" (Palmer 696).

### However, as Aristotle defines in *Politics*, the democracy is a deviation from a more pure form of government--the constitutional government or polity.

### Furthermore, Engels and Lenin argue that the state is a machine for oppression of one class by another, in democratic republics no less than in monarchies.

## thesis

Although the first world war was \"indeed a victory for democracy,\"
neither the victors nor the aftermath promoted widespread liberty.

## The victors of the first world war were democracies and tyrannies, not polities, and they did not promote widespread liberty.

### \<need something about wage slavery in the us, france, and britain\>

## In addition, the post-war German \"republic\" was not conducive to liberty

The new German republic, who professed their own ideals, did not feel
responsible or attached to the previous regime. However, the treaty
makers in Paris in 1919 working under public pressure and \"still in the
heat of the war\"

## Furthermore, the colonial aftermath of the first world war was neither democratic nor liberating.
