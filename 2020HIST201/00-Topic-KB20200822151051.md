**Before we start, notes pre-globalization**

* Spanish royals actively prevented trade with China #why
* Current day, emphasis was placed around those in native American regions who were anti-Spanish, yet a large majority of the individuals who really brought globalization were Spanish 

# Effects of the Homogenoscene
    
## Silver...
* (Most?) Important asset  
* Got cheapened as soon as the Americas overflowed with it, leading to lot’s of silver problems [[KB20200822151428]]

## Capital Movement  
### Original, pre-globalized capitals
* All located within the tropics
    * Beijing  
    * Viayanagar (Hindu capital) – Cairo
* Decidedly not western  
* Decidedly hot (maybe, but Beijing was definitely not hot #why)

### Globalized Capitals
* In the north, mostly
    * New York  
    * Chicago  
    * Tokyo  
    * Manchester
    * London
* Much more westiner
* ...and much colder
