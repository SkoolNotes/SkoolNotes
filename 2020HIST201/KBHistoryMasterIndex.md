1. the class predictions are the generated "labels" for each class -- this is ordered by number, and should hence just be [0 1].
2. the probabilities are ordered by the class predictions. The model would be less confident as the overlap between features increases. 
3. the closer the average heights are, the less value it has as a differentiator; thus, the model becomes less confident in it's predictions. 
4. if a coeficant is negative, it means that as that feature increases the given sample is less likely to belong to the given class -- eg. Liking garlic to being a vampire.
