Pyhs, Bio, ISOS, som, english, calc, japanese, ml, hist

- Physics:
	- A topic I have been interested in for a long time, but never been able to pursue as basically all of my science knowledge is self taught and that doesn't work great for phys. Goal here would simply be to gain a solid understanding of physics, bare minimum being enough for me to continue to learn myself. AKA create a starting point. 
- Bio:
	- Relatively familiar with Bio, but there is an endless amount to learn here. Goal would simply be to learn, and in bio I can do that by doing my bio work well. 
- English:
	- Get faster at writing essays. Convince a teacher that close reading is not inherently valuable. 
- Calculus: 
	- This class is more about understanding the content than individual exploration. 
- Japanese:
	- In this class my goal is to achieve the goals my teacher sets for me. I do not have enough knowledge for the subject to create informed goals. 
- Ml:
	- My goal here is to truly understand the topics at a deeper level. In Ml at this level, it's relatively easy just to read the documentation and write {insert_function_type}.fit(), but that's not enough for me. 
- History:
	- I don't feel that I am informed well enough about history to create a specific goal, besides "do well."
