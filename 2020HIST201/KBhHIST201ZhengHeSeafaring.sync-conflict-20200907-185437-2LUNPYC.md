# Ming China's Seafaring
**Zheng He's Expedition**: Famous official overseas official expedition

* Seeked tribute and coordination from other nations
* Forced others to acknowledge Beijing
* Ships returned with great gifts/weird things
    * Giraffs — as… entertainment
    * A chief — for he did not acknowledge the emperor
* Apparently never plundered/murdered + killed only on Emperor's orders

Eventually, China stopped seafaring + much of external trade. See [[KBhHIST201ChinasDecline1500]] China's Decline in the 1500s
