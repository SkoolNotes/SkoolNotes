**First, a free-write**: why does war exist? Are they products of failure in other realms or logical products of global systems? What would be required to put an end to war? Is there just/good/ethical wars.

War exists when traditional systems of diplomacy failed to produce an adequate enough solution that pleases both parties. They are logical products of perhaps not global systems but the sheer competitive and animistic nature of human beings. Because wars are generally more binary things than traditional diplomacy (enemies are bad, allies are good, kill the enemies, support the allies), they are instruments that a state could more easily summon efforts to and propagandize upon than a compromise-based diplomatic agreements. 

This animistic and binary nature also means that wars could only end when one of both of the conditions fail: either the parties agree to compromise — an act that elevates them from the realms of the "beast" to that of the "person" — or one party dominate the other, which upsets the binary nature of conflict and reduces the action to the direct action of dominance.

Because ethical standards are a humanistic construct, wars — an animistic action — could never really be ethical.

- Conflicts naturally happen, but wars are more difficult to say
	- Globalized wars is slightly more unnatural compared to localized conflicts
