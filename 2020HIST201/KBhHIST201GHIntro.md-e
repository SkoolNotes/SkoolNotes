**Goal**: how did the global history influence and cause us to end up where we are today?

> History as familiar? vs. History as foreign? vs. History as present?

*Curiosities from history*

* Gender worked differently
* "Horsemanning" => an early form of memeary

*** 

# History as the reflection of the present

> As these countries move forward in time, they could become interdependent

* Events in history could reflect examples for the present


# Big questions

* When did world history became "global history"?
* What forces connected the various regions in the world?
* Since when and in what parts did world history became the history of the West?
    * Where is the West, anyways?
    * How do you define the West?
