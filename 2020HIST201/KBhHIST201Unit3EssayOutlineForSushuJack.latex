\section{Industrial Revolution Essay
(Outline)}\label{industrial-revolution-essay-outline}}

\textbf{For a nation-state to achieve global success and dominance in
the 19th century, they must leverage industrial modernization: bringing
the increased fighting power of an industrialized modern military, the
economic benefits of adopting and weaponizing free trade, and the
centralized political control offered by top-down civic nationalism.}

\hypertarget{modern-industrialized-military-brings-increased-fighting-power}{%
\subsection{Modern, industrialized military brings increased fighting
power}\label{modern-industrialized-military-brings-increased-fighting-power}}

England's unification efforts allowed the country to gather a huge
competitive advantage over other, less-developed nation-states.

New industrialized technology made the military much better: ``the
advanced technology of steam engines and machine-made tools gave Europe
decisive economic and military advantages.'' (Kennedy Ch. 4)

This advantage manifests itself in two core ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Modern military is much more economically and physically efficient
\item
  Modern military is stronger and could easily fight over other advanced
  yet unindustrialized military
\end{enumerate}

``Despite a steady reduction in its own numbers after 1815, the Royal
Navy was at some times probably as powerful as the next three or four
navies in actual fighting power.'' (Kennedy Ch. 4). Due to to Britian's
steady technological advancement, the British Royal Navy was able to use
its advanced technology --- of which it was one the first to adopt ---
to offset its reduced numbers.

In addition to increased efficiency, the advanced technologies adopted
by the British Royal Navy also allowed it to conquer even traditionally
powerful armies with ease.

``The steam-driven gunboat meant that European sea power, already
supreme in open waters, could be extended inland. \ldots{} The ironclad
\emph{Nemesis} \ldots{} was a disaster for the defending Chinese forces,
which were easily brushed aside.'' (Kennedy Ch. 4) Without the
technologies of the steam engine --- the hallmark of industrialization,
it would be impossible for the British military to be able to so
efficiently threaten the Chinese rule.

Both of these factors would not exist because without the advent of the
advanced military technologies brought by industrialization.

\hypertarget{state-support-and-weaponization-of-free-trade-and-private-production-brought-wealth-and-economic-power}{%
\subsection{State support and weaponization of free-trade and private
production brought wealth and economic
power}\label{state-support-and-weaponization-of-free-trade-and-private-production-brought-wealth-and-economic-power}}

In the 19th century, states began the ``erosion of tariff barriers
\ldots{} {[}and{]} the widespread propergation of ideas about free trade
and incarnation.'' (Kennedy Ch. 4) These devices allowed economy to flow
freely throughout the world economy, and allowed the novel technologies
of industrialization that sprung up in Europe to spread rapidly.

European states actively leveraged their newly-advantageous position in
global trade to bring further economic wealth to them. The systems of
Imperialism were in part created to propagate European ideas of free
trade to more difficult markets like that of Asia or Africa: ``European
states sought `sheltered markets' free from such restrictions to trade
and found them in the colonies they established.'' (Mason Ch. 8 )

This forcible induction of state-sponsored ``free trade'' had
significant advantages for European nations such as Britian. Although
opium trade to China was officially managed by the private British East
India Co., Britian did not hesitate to leverage their army to force
trading to continue: when Canton commisoner Lin Zexu threatened the
Crown's opium trade, ``Britain sent an expeditionary military force
\ldots{} {[}that{]} the Chinese had no naval forces capable of
defeating.'' (Ropp Late Qing).

The legacy Chinese forces had little capability to defend themselves
against the newly-strengthened British forces as per aforementioned, and
hence was forced to continue trade --- a lucrative business for the
British that not only offsetted their trade deficit with the Qing court,
but made an additional \$1 Million in profit. Arguably, the sustenance
of the opium trade in late Qing China is also one of the reasons that
the administration eventually collapsed

\hypertarget{promotion-of-civically-nationalistic-governance}{%
\subsection{Promotion of Civically Nationalistic
Governance}\label{promotion-of-civically-nationalistic-governance}}

During the 19th century, two major European players --- Germany and
Italy --- were created from the advent of civic nationalistic ideals.
These new nations rapidly became modernized, developed, and rose to be a
world player in global power balance.

Throughout Europe, ``Statesmen \ldots{} were using warfare and civic
nationalism to forge powerful new nation-states'' (Mason Ch. 7). The
control offered by nationalistic ideals offered unique,
counter-balancing forces that created an opportunity for the ruling
class to both efficiently control subjects and ensure the integrity of
the nation.

Although it is not a strictly nationalistic speech, the Iron and Blood
address by the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck rings with deeply
nationalistic sentiments: ``the position of Prussia in Germany \ldots{}
will be determined \ldots{} by iron and blood'' --- rallying the
citizens to powerful action under the image of ``Germans'': a
\emph{national identity} previously separated from statehood.

In this maneuver, Bismarck created the German confederation --- an act
that strengthened the already-dominant position of Prussia for dominance
in their European region.

\section{Paragraph on Nationalism}\label{paragraph-on-nationalism}}

In addition to the technical and economic prowess brought by
industrialization, the 19th century also engendered a new wave of
governance that rapidly enabled the growth of new, powerful nations.
Throughout Europe, ``Statesmen \ldots{} were using warfare and civic
nationalism to forge new nation-states'' (Mason Ch. 7) like that of
Germany and Italy --- creating soon-to-be dominant players on world
power balance. The process Civic nationalism is hugely effective partly
due to the duality of control it offers. Firstly, nationalism in itself
ensures the unity of a nation-state for it secures national uniformity
not under forced rule but under a shared identity: ``a nation is a group
of people with a common culture, a sense of identity, and political
aspirations \ldots{} {[}it{]} requires the psychological element of
identity''. Indeed, a sense of togetherness and common goal could be
created without having to resort to sheer physical and political
leverage --- creating a perfect space for the governance style of civic
nationalism. ``Civic nationalism {[}is{]} directed from the top'' (Mason
Ch. 7), allowing seat of power to directly implement actions in the
uniform populous psychologically primed to support actions that would
further the nation's shared aspirations. This feature of civic
nationalism expedites policy decisions --- allowing powerful nations to
be created with reasonably rapid pace. Conversely, states not following
generally civic nationalistic governance may experience ``separatism'':
attempts of enforcing \emph{civic} control without the establishment
(or, in multiculturalistic states, the possibility) of nationalism. When
faced with European competition, the Ottoman empire established a
campaign of ``Defensive Developmentalism'', where a combination of
``military reform {[}and{]} \ldots{} discipline and coordinat{[}tion
of{]} their population'' (Gelvin Ch. 5) --- actions that enforce direct
civic control --- lead to revolts and conflicts between both each .
