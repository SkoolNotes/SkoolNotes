#+TITLE: WWI happens
* when the war began, people realized offense wasn't actually dominant
** defense was actually easier than offenese
* why not stop (why didn't they cut their losses)
** pride
** sunk cost fallacy - both sides thought they might /just/ be able to win
*** maybe if one government can outlast another (if enemy is about to collapse) then it'll be over soon
** people had been expecting it
** this idea that the people who back down first will loose
** defending still seems riskier
** preempting being better assumes element of surprise, but everyone was expecting it
** prefer that the war happens on someone else's turf
* defense is relatively easy
** machine guns and trenches are too effective for cutting down foot soldiers
** no tanks to deal with barbed wire and machine gun fire
* tanks
** too little, too late
** unfortunately, europeans learn the wrong lesson and people leave thinking defense is better
