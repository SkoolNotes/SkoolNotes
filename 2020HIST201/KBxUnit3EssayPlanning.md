Unit 3 Essay: 19th Century Transformations

Essay option 1: The political, economic, and technological transformations of the 19th century drastically changed the global power balance. In some cases, they made already strong states dramatically more powerful: witness Great Britain. In other cases, they paved the way for new, rising powers such as Japan, Germany, and Italy. And in still other cases, such as Egypt, India, China, Southeast Asia and Africa, they led to foreign intervention, imperialism and the loss of independence. What factor or factors most strongly determined which states would increase or decline in power in this time period (1815 to roughly 1900)? Answer this question with a thesis that addresses several, diverse examples from across the world. Tip: rather than accumulating a long, complex list of unrelated factors, simplify and pare down your thesis, saving the complexity for your examples.

Essay option 2:  According to Charles Tilly’s “bellicist” theory of state formation, states form to protect a territory from external threats. In the process of doing this (war-making), they develop the tools to eliminate internal rivals as well (state-making), and in order to fund these endeavours, they develop institutions like taxation to raise revenue from their territory (extraction). In order to maximize the wealth available for extraction and prevent property owners from needing private armies to protect themselves, the state establishes rule of law to protect property rights (protection). Insufficient state capacity in one of these domains is thus likely to affect the others. The 19th century is an especially interesting era in which to see this theory in action, as it witnesses the rise and fall of a number of new and old states. Using this theory as a starting point, compare and contrast state formation in two or three 19th century states we’ve studied this unit. You should have a thesis which points out a meaningful trend, disparity or hypothesis. 

Essay option 3: The post-1815 world was born from a massive ideological upheaval: The French Revolution and the subsequent spreading of liberal and nationalist ideals throughout an increasingly interconnected world. In the century to follow, nationalism and liberalism vied with each other as well as with other ideologies such as conservatism and socialism/communism. Blends of these existed as well. In an essay drawing upon specific examples from across the world, argue which of these ideologies was most transformative or important to understanding the events of the 19th century. Tip: the contrast between ideologies can help make your argument be more debatable and have more power-- show, for example, why liberalism had more of an impact than nationalism alone, or vice versa.

Note: Essays (either option) should cite from a wide variety of sources from the Unit 3 Reader. 

Other Submission guidelines: 3-4 pages, size 12 font, double-spaced. Citations should be in-line and formatted as (Authorname Pagenumber) i.e. (Kennedy 12). Include a Works Cited page in MLA format.

### Quoute bin 

- interconnecitivty ran rampant
	- Prussian suc- cess was due in large measure to the application of new technologies to logistics and warfare: the new breech-loading “needle gun” (which could be fired from the prone position) and the use of the railroad and the tele- graph to move and coordinate troops and supplies. - mason 
	- he empi re was so widesp read that it was difficu lt for the power of the central government to radiate out throug h the provinces, even with the use of nineteenth· century technologies such as telegraphs and railroads. - gelvin 
	- The telegraph rapidly became as conventional a presence in the nineteenth century as the cell phone is today. And like other nineteenth century inventions -s teamboats and railroads and the Gatling gun - the telegraph proved to be an indispensable tool of imperialism - gelvin 
	- 
- britain embraced interconnectivity (embraced/made profit off of trade, had a strong navy) 
- 
- japan 54! 57! 
	- started as closed off
	- opened up
		-  In the summer of 1898, Kang Youwei, a brilliant Confucian scholar who admired Japan for its rapid adoption of Western institutions and industrialization, - ropp 
	- took stuff and became powerful 

- china resisted interconnevtivity
	- here were Confucian officials in the late nineteenth century who called for “self-strengthening,” learning from the West, and who began to build modern weapons, steamships, railroads and telegraph lines. But the Qing Empire was a vast, poor, mostly agricultural and overpopulated territory with a small, weak gov ernment, and the modernization efforts were confined to tiny coastal areas that had little impact inland. - ropp
	- - liked japans industrialization (see above) then "ordered the reform movement crushed." - ropp 

- china got fricked 
	- In 1894-1895, fighting over influence in Korea, Japanese troops quickly and soundly defeated Qing forces.  - ropp
	- In September 1899, John Hay, America’s secretary of state, issued a series of “Open Door Notes” to Britain, France, Ger many, Russia, Italy, and Japan, calling on all foreign powers in China to allow free trade in all spheres of influence. - ropp 
	


### Outline 

###### title: freedom, or else.
