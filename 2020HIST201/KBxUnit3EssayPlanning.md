Unit 3 Essay: 19th Century Transformations

Essay option 1: The political, economic, and technological transformations of the 19th century drastically changed the global power balance. In some cases, they made already strong states dramatically more powerful: witness Great Britain. In other cases, they paved the way for new, rising powers such as Japan, Germany, and Italy. And in still other cases, such as Egypt, India, China, Southeast Asia and Africa, they led to foreign intervention, imperialism and the loss of independence. What factor or factors most strongly determined which states would increase or decline in power in this time period (1815 to roughly 1900)? Answer this question with a thesis that addresses several, diverse examples from across the world. Tip: rather than accumulating a long, complex list of unrelated factors, simplify and pare down your thesis, saving the complexity for your examples.

Essay option 2:  According to Charles Tilly’s “bellicist” theory of state formation, states form to protect a territory from external threats. In the process of doing this (war-making), they develop the tools to eliminate internal rivals as well (state-making), and in order to fund these endeavours, they develop institutions like taxation to raise revenue from their territory (extraction). In order to maximize the wealth available for extraction and prevent property owners from needing private armies to protect themselves, the state establishes rule of law to protect property rights (protection). Insufficient state capacity in one of these domains is thus likely to affect the others. The 19th century is an especially interesting era in which to see this theory in action, as it witnesses the rise and fall of a number of new and old states. Using this theory as a starting point, compare and contrast state formation in two or three 19th century states we’ve studied this unit. You should have a thesis which points out a meaningful trend, disparity or hypothesis. 

Essay option 3: The post-1815 world was born from a massive ideological upheaval: The French Revolution and the subsequent spreading of liberal and nationalist ideals throughout an increasingly interconnected world. In the century to follow, nationalism and liberalism vied with each other as well as with other ideologies such as conservatism and socialism/communism. Blends of these existed as well. In an essay drawing upon specific examples from across the world, argue which of these ideologies was most transformative or important to understanding the events of the 19th century. Tip: the contrast between ideologies can help make your argument be more debatable and have more power-- show, for example, why liberalism had more of an impact than nationalism alone, or vice versa.

Note: Essays (either option) should cite from a wide variety of sources from the Unit 3 Reader. 

Other Submission guidelines: 3-4 pages, size 12 font, double-spaced. Citations should be in-line and formatted as (Authorname Pagenumber) i.e. (Kennedy 12). Include a Works Cited page in MLA format.

- interconnecitivty ran rampant
	- Prussian suc- cess was due in large measure to the application of new technologies to logistics and warfare: the new breech-loading “needle gun” (which could be fired from the prone position) and the use of the railroad and the tele- graph to move and coordinate troops and supplies. - mason

	- The telegraph rapidly became as conventional a presence in the nineteenth century as the cell phone is today. And like other nineteenth century inventions -s teamboats and railroads and the Gatling gun - the telegraph proved to be an indispensable tool of imperialism - gelvin

In the next year the Japanese began to comply, and in 1867 an internal revolution took place, of which the most conspicuous consequence was a rapid westernizing of Japanese life and institu tions. But if it looked as if the country had been “opened" by Westerners, actually Japan had exploded from within. - palmer 
		- For over two centuries Japan had followed a program of self-imposed isolation. No Japa nese was allowed to leave the islands or even to build a ship large enough to navigate the high seas.

- china resisted interconnevtivity
	- here were Confucian officials in the late nineteenth century who called for “self-strengthening,” learning from the West, and who began to build modern weapons, steamships, railroads and telegraph lines.

	- Qing government saw inter national trade not as a way to generate new wealth but as a privilege granted to less-developed “barbarians” in exchange for their paying respects to the Son of Heaven and his court.

### Kinda wanna be more than friendsssss

The major deciding factor in a states change in power in the 19th century was its willingness to embrace interconnectivity.




Britain heavily embraced interconnectivity, leveraging it for profit. Trade, one of Britain's main sources of income, is one of the main ways interconnectivity manifests. Britain heavily promoted trade, even going to the lengths of taking territory from other states and turning it into "important commercial and trading centers" (mason). They focused on developing a powerful navy, which became "the largest in the world" (kennedy). This navy effectively served as a tool for propagating interconnectivity, as seafaring was the primary means of transferring goods and ideas between states. They used this navy to enforce free trade and manage trade routes, further promoting interconnectivity and eventually leading to the "spectacular growth of an integrated global economy [...] and financial network centered [...] upon Great Britain" (kennedy). Of course, Britain benefited massively off of this newly created integrated financial network, which, along with it's goods, would spread ideas. Expanding and rising in power immensely, Britain truly was one of the driving forces behind this interconnectivity revolution. 




After centuries of isolation, Japan accepted the interconnectivity revolution and prospered because of it. During Japan's period of self isolation, "no Japanese was allowed to leave the islands or even to build a ship large enough to navigate the high seas. No foreigner [...] was allowed to enter" (palmer). Japan had little power, little influence, and was the antithesis of an interconnected state. This isolation continued until 1853, when "the American Commodore Perry forced his way with a fleet of naval vessels into Yedo Bay," initiating Japan into the interconnectivity revolution. Commodore Perry demanded that the Japanese engage in trade with the Western powers, and "the Japanese began to comply [...] in 1867 an internal revolution took place, of which the most conspicuous consequence was a rapid westernizing of Japanese life and institutions" (palmer). In what is now called the Meiji era, spanning from 1868 to 1912, Japan experienced a complete shift from isolation to being the model of a modern nation state.
