# The Industrial Revolution

## Background: Post Napoleon Europe...
**Post-Napoleonic International System was "strange"**

### New International Order
@[[KBhHIST201MasonAndKennedy]]

* Erosion of tariff barrieriers + widespread free trade ideals => new international order
* Struggle between 1793-1815 ("Great War") caused a **yearning for stability**

The newfound yearning caused a longer term wish for stability... But! Wars did not end: **Regional/individual conflicts {territory, nationality, etc.} persisted**. however, this did manage to limit the scope of conflicts

* Europe's technical superiority increased the conflict for the less developed
* CLAIM: military power accompanied the economic globalization @Kennedy, [[KBhHIST201MasonAndKennedy]]


## The Industrial Revolution
\definition{Industrial Revolution}{The substitution of inanimate for animated sources of power through the conversion of heat into work.}

@Kennedy [[KBhHIST201MasonAndKennedy]]'s thesis claim Thesis CLAIM: international economy growth, Industrial Revolution, European stability, and military modernization => favored Great Powers

Of course, IR is a very _slow_ process.

### The Revolution
* At its nascent stages started affecting only a certain amount of manufacturers + is a slow-moving process

**Is Technologically Beneficial**: allowed mankind to explore new sources of energy. For instance, twenty-folded the production of driven looms

**Had cascading effect**: better access to technology turned textile industry to be more productive which created a demand to more machines, cotton, iron, and communication

Also other systemic benefits like the creation of a the wage-labor factory work system => massive increase in productivity.

### Impacts of IR
The Industrial Revolution, of course, had lots of impacts. Please see [[KBhHIST201ImpactsofIR]]
