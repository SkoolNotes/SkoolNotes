## intuit

A subspace $U$ is called invariant on $T$ if $T\big|_U$ is closed in
$U$. (BUT it is not nessecarily an operator!) Aka the map is closed
under the subspace.

## results

### finite dimensional subspaces of sufficiently large dimension (1 for $\mathbb F = \mathbb C$ and 2 for $\mathbb F = \mathbb R$)
