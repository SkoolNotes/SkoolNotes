The real spectral theorem suggests that if a map is self-adjoint, it
must have an orthogonal basis of eigenvalues. Thus, we can choose a map
which does not have an orthogonal basis of eigenvalues. For instance,
choose the eigenvalues $$\begin{aligned}
T(1, 0, 0) = (1, 0, 0)\\
T(0, 1, 0) = (0, 2, 0)\\
T(1, 1, 1) = (3, 3, 3)\\
\end{aligned}$$ In other words, let $T \in  \mathcal{L}(\mathbb{R}^3)$
be defined by
