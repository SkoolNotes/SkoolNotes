  - A list of vectors is called /orthonormal/ if each vector in the list has norm 1 and is orthogonal to all other vectors in the list
  - in other words, a list $e_1, \ldots, e_m$ of vectors in $V$ is orthonormal if
  \[\begin{aligned}
  \langle  e_j, e_k \rangle = \begin{cases}1 & \text{ if } j = k \\ 0 & \text{ if } j \neq  k\end{cases}
  \end{aligned}\]

** Axler6.25 norm of an orthonormal linear combination Pythagorean theorem
   If $e_1, \ldots, e_m$ is an orthonormal list of vectors in $V$ then
   \[\begin{aligned}
   \lVert a_1 e_1 + \cdots + a_m e_m \rVert ^2 = \vert a_1 \vert ^2 + \cdots + \lvert a_m \rvert^2
   \end{aligned}\]
   Pythagorean theorem
** Axler6.26 orthonormal lists are linearly independent
   Any orthogonal list is linearly independent, so an orthonormal list must also be linearly independent.
