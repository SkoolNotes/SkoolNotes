  - A list of vectors is called /orthonormal/ if each vector in the list has norm 1 and is orthogonal to all other vectors in the list
  - in other words, a list $e_1, \ldots, e_m$ of vectors in $V$ is orthonormal if
  \[\begin{aligned}
  \langle  e_j, e_k \rangle = \begin{cases}1 & \text{ if } j = k \\ 0 & \text{ if } j \neq  k\end{cases}
  \end{aligned}\]
