# Axler7.18 normal [[def]{.smallcaps}]{.tag tag-name="def"} {#axler7.18-normal}

Not to be confused with [normal vectors](KBrefNormal.org), which have
[norm](KBrefNorm.org) 1.

> -   An operator on an inner product space is called *normal* if it
>     commutes with its adjoint.
> -   aka: $T \in  \mathcal{L}(V)$ is *normal* if

> $$\begin{aligned}

Every [self adjoint](KBrefSelfAdjointOperators.org) operator is normal,
because $TT = TT$

# results

## Axler7.20 $T$ is normal iff $\lVert Tv \rVert = \lVert T^* v \rVert$ for all $v$

This implies that $\onull T = \onull T^*$ for all normal operators $T$..

## Axler7.21 For $T$ normal, $T$ and $T^*$ have the same eigenvectors

> And the corresponding eigenvalues are conjugates of one another.

## Axler7.22 Normal operators have orthogonal eigenvectors

> Suppose $T \in  \mathcal{L}(V)$ is normal. Then eigenvectors of $T$
> corresponding to disticnct eigenvalues are orthogonal.
