* motivation
** The norm of a complex number $\lVert z \rVert$ should be non-negative, so we can define it as
   \[\begin{aligned}
   \lVert z \rVert =\sqrt{|z_1|^2 + \cdots + |z_n| ^2}
   \end{aligned}\]
   Since the square of the absolute value is just a complex number times a conjugate, and because the norm squared should be the inner product of $z$ with itself, maybe the inner product of $w, z \in  \CC ^n$ should equal
   \[\begin{aligned}
   w_1 \overline{z_1} + \cdots + w_n \overline{z_n}
   \end{aligned}\]
