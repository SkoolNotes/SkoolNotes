* Algebreic and Geometric Multiplicities
  I missed the last ten minutes of class and had to look up what the algebreic and geometric multiplicities are. I used this [[https://people.math.carleton.ca/~kcheung/math/notes/MATH1107/wk10/10_algebraic_and_geometric_multiplicities.html][source]].

  Also it says something about
  #+begin_quote
  It is a fact that summing up the algebraic multiplicities of all the eigenvalues of an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ gives exactly $n$.
  #+end_quote
  Which reminds me of the fundamental theorem of algebra...

** $\begin{pmatrix}4&-12\\2&0\end{pmatrix}$

*** Geometric multiplicity
	The null space is $\text{span } \begin{pmatrix}1\\1\end{pmatrix}$ which is dimension 1.

*** Algebraic multiplicity
	The determinant of $\begin{pmatrix}2&-2\\2&-2\end{pmatrix}$ is
	\[ -2(4-\lambda)-2(-\lambda) = 0 \]
	which makes sense because the matrix is singular.
