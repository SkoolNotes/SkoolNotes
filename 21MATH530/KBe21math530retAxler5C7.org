* Exercise 7
  #+begin_quote
  Suppose $T \in  \mathcal{L} (V)$ has a diagonal matrix $A$ with respect to some basis of $V$ and that $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$. Prove that $\lambda$ appears on the diagonal of $A$ precisely $\odim E(\lambda, T)$ times.

* Proof
  We will show that for each eigenvalue $\lambda$, there are at least $E(\lambda, T)$ occurrences of that eigenvalue and at most $E(\lambda, T)$ occurrences.

  Suppose $\lambda$ is on the diagonal $m$ times. Each of those occurrences corresponds to where the diagonal matrix sends a (linearly independent) basis eigenvector, which implies that the basis of $V$ has at least $m$ eigenvectors corresponding to $\lambda$. These $m$ eigenvectors can be extended to a basis of $E(\lambda, T)$, implying that $\dim E(\lambda T) \geq m$.

** TODO Suppose $\lambda$ is on the diagonal $m$ times.
