* Algebreic and Geometric Multiplicities
  I missed the last ten minutes of class and had to look up what the algebreic and geometric multiplicities are. I used this [[https://people.math.carleton.ca/~kcheung/math/notes/MATH1107/wk10/10_algebraic_and_geometric_multiplicities.html][source]].

  Also it says something about

  It is a fact that summing up the algebraic multiplicities of all the eigenvalues of an $n\times n$ matrix
