  Suppose $T \in  \mathcal{L} (V)$ and $p \in \mathcal{P} (\mathbb{F} )$ is a polynomial given by

  \[\begin{aligned}
  P(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + \cdots + a_m z^m
  \end{aligned}\]
  for $z \in  \mathbb{F} $. Then $p(T)$ is the operator defined by
  \[\begin{aligned}
  p(T) = a_0I + a_1T + a_2T^2 + \cdots + a_m T^m
  \end{aligned}\]
