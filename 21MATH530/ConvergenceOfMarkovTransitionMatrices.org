#+TITLE: Convergence of Transition Matrices in Markov Trains
* First, show all eigenvalues are complete and at most 1
* then, it must converge because the $\lambda = 1$ eigenvalues send their inputs to the same thing each time, and the other ones are less than one so they end up going to zero
* convergence speed: larger non-1 eigenvalues will cause the chain to converge more slowly
