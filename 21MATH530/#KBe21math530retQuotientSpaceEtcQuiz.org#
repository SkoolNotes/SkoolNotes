* Definitions
** affine subset
   An affine subset of a vector space $V$ is of the form $U + v$ where $U \subseteq V$ and $v \in V$.
** product space
   The product of some vector spaces $V_1 \times \cdots \times V_n$ is the set of lists of vectors with one from each respective space:
   \[ \{ (v_1, \ldots, v_n) : v_1 \in V_1, \ldots, v_n \in V_n \} \]
** quotient space
   A quotient space $V/U$ is the set of affine subsets $\{ U+v : v \in V \}$ (although some of those affine subsets are equivalent).
** equivalence relation
   An equivalence relation is a set of elements that are considered equivalent (equal to eachother). For example, in a vector space $U$, $U+0 = U+u \forall u \in U$.
* Why "product" and "quotient" are used to describe these operations
  The product of vector spaces is essentially a cartesian product. With real num
