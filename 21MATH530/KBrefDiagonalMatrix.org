  #+begin_quote
  An operator $T \in  \mathcal{L} (V)$ is called /diagonalizable/ if the operator has a diagonal matrix with respect to some basis of $V$.

** results
*** Axler5.41 conditions equivalent to diagonalizability
	#+begin_quote
	Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional  and $T \in  \mathcal{L} (V)$. Let $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_m$ denote the distinct eigenvalues of $T$. Then the following are equivalent:
	1. $T$ is diagonalizable
	2. $V$ has a basis consisting of eigenvalues of $T$
	3. there exist 1-dimensional subspaces $U_1, \ldots, U_n$ of $V$, each invariant under $T$, s.t.
	\[\begin{aligned}
    V = U_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus U_n
	\end{aligned}\]
	4. $V = E(\lambda_1, T) \oplus \cdots \oplus E(\lambda_m, T)$ ($V$ is the (direct) sum of eigenspaces)
	5. $\odim V = \odim E(\lambda_1, T) + \cdots + \odim E(\lambda_m, T)$

	#+end_quote
*** Axler5.44 Enough eigenvalues implies diagonalizability
	#+begin_quote
	If $T\in \mathcal{L} (V)$ has $\odim V$ distinct eigenvalues, then $T$ is diagonalizable.
	#+end_quote
**** intuition
	 Because distinct eigenvalues correspond to linearly independent eigenvectors, so there will be enough linearly independent eigenvecs to form a basis and thus a diagonal matrix
