#+TITLE: Diagonal Matrix and Diagonalizability
* diagonal matrix                                                       :def:
  #+begin_quote
  A /diagonal matrix/ is a square matrix that is zero everywhere except possibly along the [[file:KBrefDiagonalOfAMatrix.org][diagonal]].
  #+end_quote
** results
*** every diagonal matrix is upper triangular
* diagonalizable                                                        :def:
  #+begin_quote
  An operator $T \in  \mathcal{L} (V)$ is called /diagonalizable/ if the operator has a diagonal matrix with respect to some basis of $V$.
  #+end_quote
** results
*** Axler5.41 conditions equivalent to diagonalizability
