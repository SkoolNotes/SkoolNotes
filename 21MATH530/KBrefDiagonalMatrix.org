  #+begin_quote
  A /diagonal matrix/ is a square matrix that is zero everywhere except possibly along the [[file:KBrefDiagonalOfAMatrix.org][diagonal]].
  #+end_quote
** results
*** every diagonal matrix is upper triangular
* diagonalizable                                                        :def:
  #+begin_quote
  An operator $T \in  \mathcal{L} (V)$ is called /diagonalizable/ if the operator has a diagonal matrix with respect to some basis of $V$.
  #+end_quote
** results
*** Axler5.41 conditions equivalent to diagonalizability
	#+begin_quote
	Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional  and $T \in  \mathcal{L} (V)$. Let $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_m$ denote the distinct eigenvalues of $T$. Then the following are equivalent:
	1. $T$ is diagonalizable
	2. $V$ has a basis consisting of eigenvaules of $T$
