# Axler6.45 orthogonal complement, $U^\bot$

> if $U$ is a subset of $V$, then the orthogonal complement of $U$,

## results

### Axler6.46 basic properties

1.  complement is a subspace: if $U$ is a subset of $V$, then $U^\bot$
    is a subspace of $V$

2.  $\{0\}^\bot = V$

3.  $V ^\bot = \{0\}$

4.  If $U$ is a subset of $V$, then $U \cap U^\bot\subseteq \{0\}$
