## results

### Axler6.46 basic properties

1.  complement is a subspace: if $U$ is a subset of $V$, then $U^\bot$
    is a subspace of $V$

    1.  zero is orthogonal to each vector, any vector that is the sum of
        two fully orthogonal vectors or the scalar multiple of an
        orthogonal vector will still be fully orthogonal.

2.  $\{0\}^\bot = V$

    1.  zero orthogonal to every vector

3.  $V ^\bot = \{0\}$

    1.  only zero orthogonal to every vector

4.  If $U$ is a subset of $V$, then $U \cap U^\bot\subseteq \{0\}$

    1.  only zero is orthogonal to itself

5.  If $U$ and $W$ are subsets of $V$ and $U\subseteq W$ then
    $W^\bot \subseteq U^\bot$

    1.  Everything in $W^\bot$ is in $U^\bot$, and more.

### Axler6.47 direct sum of a subspace and its orthogonal complement

> Suppose $U$ is a finite-dimensional subspace of $V$. Then,
> $$\begin{aligned}
> V = U \oplus U^\bot
> \end{aligned}$$

This can be shown by seeing that splitting any vector in $V$ into a $U$
part and a non-$U$ part leads to the non-$U$ being in $U^\bot$

### Axler6.50 dimension of orthogonal complement

> Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $U$ is a subpsace of $V$. Then,
>
> $$\begin{aligned}
> \odim $U^\bot$ = $\odim V - \odim U$
> \end{aligned}$$

By the dimension of a subspace addition (Axler3.78)

### Axler6.51 orthogonal complement of orthogonal complement is itself

> Suppose $U$ is a finite-dimensional subspace of $V$. Then
> $$\begin{aligned}
> U = (U^\bot) ^\bot
> \end{aligned}$$

Because $U \oplus U^\bot = V$ is a direct sum and equals $V$.

The actual proof is by double-inclusion.
