* orthogonal decomposition
  An orthogonal decomposition is a way of writing some vector $v \neq 0 \in V$ as the scaled other vector $u \in V$ plus an orthogonal component
  #+begin_quote
  Suppose $u, v \in V$, with $v \neq 0$. Set $c =\frac{\langle u, v \rangle}{\lVert v \rVert^2}$ and $w = u - cv$. Then,
  \[\begin{aligned}
  \langle w, v \rangle = 0\text{   and   } u = cv + w
  \end{aligned}\]

  The important algebra is just setting up
