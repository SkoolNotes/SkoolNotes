* Axler6.45 orthogonal complement, $U^\bot$
  #+begin_quote
  if $U$ is a subset of $V$, then the orthogonal complement of $U$, denoted $U^\bot$, is the set of all vectors in $V$ that are orthogonal to every vector in $U$:

  \[\begin{aligned}
  U^\bot = \{ v \in V : \langle v, u \rangle = 0 \forall u \in  U \}
  \end{aligned}\]
