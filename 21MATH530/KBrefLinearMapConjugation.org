#+TITLE: Conjugation of Linear Maps
* conjugation                                                           :def:
  #+begin_quote
  \[\begin{aligned}
  TST^-, T^-ST

* significance
  Kind of like changing the basis of the map in the middle.

  Also tells us something about how $T, S$ commute, because if they commuted fully then the expression would just be $S$.
