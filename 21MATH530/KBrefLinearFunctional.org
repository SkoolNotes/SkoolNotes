  A /linear functional/ on $V$ is a linear map from $V$ to $\mathbb F$. In other words, a linear functional is an element of $\mathcal L(V, \mathbb F)$

** Axler6.42 Riesz Representation Theorem
  Any map defined by $u \in  V$ that sends each $v \in  V$ to $\langle  u, v \rangle$ is a linear functional. This result says that every linear functional is such a map.
   #+begin_quote
   Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $\varphi$ is a linear functional on $V$. Then there is a unique vector $u \in  V$ s.t.
   \[\begin{aligned}
   \varphi (v) = \langle v, u \rangle
   \end{aligned}\]
   For every $v \in V$.
