* Axler6.27 orthonormal basis                                           :def:
  #+begin_quote
  An /orthonormal basis/ of $V$ is an orthonormal list of vectors in $V$ that is also a basis of $V$.
  #+end_quote

  Pretty self explanatory.
* results
** orthonormal list of the right length is a basis
   Because it's linearly independent, and linearly independent lists of the right length are bases (Axler2.39).
