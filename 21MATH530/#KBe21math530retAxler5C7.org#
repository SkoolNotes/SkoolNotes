* Exercise 7
  #+begin_quote
  Suppose $T \in  \mathcal{L} (V)$ has a diagonal matrix $A$ with respect to some basis of $V$ and that $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$. Prove that $\lambda$ appears on the diagonal of $A$ precisely $\odim E(\lambda, T)$ times.

* Proof
  There must be $\odim V$ (non-distinct) eigenvalues on the diagonal.

  Any eigenvalue $\lambda$ must have $\odim E(\lambda ,T)$ associated eigenvectors, by definition. ("In other words, $E(\lambda , T)$ is the set of all eigenvectors of $T$ corresponding to $\lambda$, along with the $0$ vector").

  $\lambda$ appears once for each
