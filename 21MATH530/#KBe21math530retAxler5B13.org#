* Axler 5.B Exercise 13
  #+begin_quote
  Suppose $W$ is a complex vector space and $T \in  \mathcal{L} (W)$ has no eigenvalues. Prove that every subspace of $W$ invariant under $T$ is either $\{0\}$ or infinite-dimensional.

* Proof
  5.21 states
  #+begin_quote
  Every operator on a finite-dimensional, nonzero, complex vector space has an eigenvalue.
  #+end_quote
  $W$ is given as a complex vector space, so to have no eigenvalues, it must be zero or infinite-dimensional. If the subspace is zero, then all subspaces must also be zero. Thus, only the infinite-dimensional case remains to be shown.

  By definition (5.14), for all subspaces $U$ of $W$ invariant under $T$, $T\big|_U$ exists in $\mathcal{L} (U)$.

  Suppose that
