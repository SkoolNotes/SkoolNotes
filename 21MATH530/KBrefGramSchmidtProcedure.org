* Axler6.31 Gram-Schmidt Procedure
  The Gram-Schmidt Procedure is used to turn a list into an orthonormal list with the same span. It's useful for finding [[file:KBrefOrthonormalBasis.org][orthonormal bases]].
  #+begin_quote
  Suppose $v_1, \ldots, v_m$ is a linearly independent list of vectors in $V$. Let $e_1 = v_1 / \lVert v_1 \rVert$. For $j = 2, \ldots, m$, define $e_j$ inductively by
  \[\begin{aligned}
  e_j = \frac{v_j - \langle  v_j, e_1 \rangle e_1 - \cdots - \langle v_j, e_{j-1} \rangle e_{j-1}}{ \lVert \text{<numerator>} \rVert  }
  \end{aligned}\]

  Then $e_1, \ldots, e_m$ is an orthonormal list of vectors in $V$ s.t. each prefix span is the same as in $v_1, \ldots, v_m$.

** intuition
   Basically, for each vector, we divide out the components from the previous vectors and then normalize the size to ensure the norm is one.
