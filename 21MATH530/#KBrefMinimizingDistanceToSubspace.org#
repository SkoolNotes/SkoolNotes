* Axler6.56 Minimizing the distance to a subspace
  #+begin_quote
  Suppose $U$ is a finite-dimensional subspace of $V$, $v \in  V$, and $u \in  U$. Then,
  \[\begin{aligned}
  \lVert v - P_U v \rVert \leq  \lVert v - u \rVert
  \end{aligned}\]
  #+end_quote

  Because we often end up having to find the minimal $v - u$ where $u \in  U$, this result makes linear algebra applicable to numerous real-world applications.

** Proof
   
   \[\begin{aligned}
   \lVert v - P_U v \rVert ^2 &\leq  \
   \end{aligned}\]

** Results
