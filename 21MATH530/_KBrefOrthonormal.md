## Axler6.25 norm of an orthonormal linear combination Pythagorean theorem

If $e_1, \ldots, e_m$ is an orthonormal list of vectors in $V$ then
$$\begin{aligned}
   \lVert a_1 e_1 + \cdots + a_m e_m \rVert ^2 = \vert a_1 \vert ^2 + \cdots + \lvert a_m \rvert^2
   \end{aligned}$$ Pythagorean theorem

## Axler6.26 orthonormal bases are linearly independent
