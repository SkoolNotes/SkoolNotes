# Axler6.56 Minimizing the distance to a subspace

> Suppose $U$ is a finite-dimensional subspace of $V$, $v \in  V$, and
> $u \in  U$. Then, $$\begin{aligned}
> \lVert v - P_U v \rVert \leq  \lVert v - u \rVert
> \end{aligned}$$

Because we often end up having to find the minimal $v - u$ where
$u \in  U$, this result makes linear algebra applicable to numerous
real-world applications.
