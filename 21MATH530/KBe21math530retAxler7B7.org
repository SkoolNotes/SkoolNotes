#+TITLE: Axler 7.B exercise 7
#+begin_quote
Suppose $V$ is a complex inner product space and $T \in  \mathcal{L}(V)$ is a normal operator such that $T^9 = T^8$. Prove that $T$ is self-adjoint and $T^2 = T$.

In 7.1, Axler asserts that $V$ is finite-dimensional.

$T$ has a diagonal matrix w.r.t. an orthonormal basis of $V$.

\[\begin{aligned}
T T^* = T^* T
\end{aligned}\]
