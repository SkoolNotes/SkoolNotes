Suppose $V$ is a complex inner product space and $T \in  \mathcal{L}(V)$ is a normal operator such that $T^9 = T^8$. Prove that $T$ is self-adjoint and $T^2 = T$.

If $T = 0$, then $0^2 = 0$ and $0$ is self-adjoint. Thus, let $T \neq  0$.

In 7.1, Axler asserts that $V$ is finite-dimensional.

$T$ has a diagonal matrix w.r.t. an orthonormal basis of $V$.

\[\begin{aligned}
T T^* = T^* T
\end{aligned}\]

First, we will show that $T^2 = T$. Suppose $T$ is invertible. Then,
\[\begin{aligned}
T^9 &= T^8 \\
T^9 T^{-7}  &= T^8 T^{-7}\\
T^2 &= T
\end{aligned}\]
Suppose $T$ is not invertible. Then, $T$ has
