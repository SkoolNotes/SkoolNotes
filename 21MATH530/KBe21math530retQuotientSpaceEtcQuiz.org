** affine subset
   An affine subset of a vector space $V$ is of the form $U + v$ where $U \subseteq V$ and $v \in V$.
** product space
   The product of some vector spaces $V_1 \times \cdots \times V_n$ is the set of lists of vectors with one from each respective space:
   \[ \{ (v_1, \ldots, v_n) | v_1 \in V_1, \ldots, v_n \in V_n \} \]
** quotient space
