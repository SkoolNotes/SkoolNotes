What happens if the Gram–Schmidt Procedure is applied to a list of vectors that is not linearly independent?

* Answer
  Suppose the list $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ is linearly dependent. Then, there exists some $v_j$ s.t. $v_1, \ldots, v_{j-1}$ is linearly independant while $v_1, \ldots, v_j$ is not. Then, $v_j \in \text{span}(v_1, \ldots, v_{j-1})$

  Because the Gram-Schmidt procedure preserves prefix spans,
\[ v_j \in \text{span}(e_1, \ldots, e_{j-1}) \]

  Thus, the denominator is equivalent to
  \[
  kvj 􏰍hvj;e1ie1 􏰍􏰎􏰎􏰎􏰍hvj;ej􏰍1iej􏰍1k
  \]
