* eigenvalues
  eigenvalue: multiplied by a scalar?
  a subspace that, when put through a linear map, only gets scaled.

  \[ Tv = \lambda v \]

  Where $v \neq 0$. (we ignore it because its no fun to send zero to zero, and bc the span is empty).

  *T must be an operator!* Otherwise the matrix sizes don't work out when subtracting $\lambda I$.

  where $v$ is the eigenvector and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue. The equation is often rewritten as:

  \[
  \begin{aligned}
  Tv - \lambda v &= 0
  Tv - \lambda Iv &= 0
  (T-\lambda I) v &= 0
  \end{aligned}
\]

  now this can be factored and roots can be found. also it's an operator.
** Axler 5.6 equivalent conditions
   Only when $V$ is finite dimensional!
*** $T-\lambda I$ is not injective, because both $v, 0$ are in the null space.
*** $T-\lambda I$ is also not surjective or invertible bc finite dim operator.

* an example
  Given the matrix $\begin{pmatrix}3&1\\0&2\end{pmatrix}$, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

  Now that we have that other fomulation, we can just subtract $\lambda I$ from $T$ to get
\[ \begin{pmatrix}3-\lambda &1\\0&2-lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

  Then, we just need to find whether it is non-invertible aka singular aka determinant.

  \[ (3-\lambda)(2-\lambda) = 0 \]
  The solutions are $\lambda = 2 \text{ or } 3$. These are the eigenvalues.

  Now just plug in $\lambda$ and find the null space using RREF. The null space for $\lambda = 3$ has null space $\text{span}(x, 0)$, so we just pick one of those vectors (ex. $(1, 0)$) to be the eigenvector.
