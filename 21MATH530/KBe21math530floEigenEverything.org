* eigenvalues
  eigenvalue: multiplied by a scalar?
  a subspace that, when put through a linear map, only gets scaled.

  \[ Tv = \lambda v \]

  *T must be an operator!* Otherwise the matrix sizes don't work out when subtracting $\lambda I$.

  where $v$ is the eigenvector and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue. The equation is often rewritten as:

  \[
  \begin{aligned}
  Tv - \lambda v &= 0
  Tv - \lambda Iv &= 0
  (T-\lambda I) v &= 0
  \end{aligned}
\]

  now this can be factored and roots can be found. also it's an operator.
** Axler 5.6 equivalent conditions

* depends on
** finding roots is helpful
