# multivariate analysis

## terms

### null hypothesis

### dependence - if one set of variables can predict another

### interdependent analysis - intercorrelations for underlying understanding

### metric vs non metric - a metric variable is numeric

## then a bunch of methods for dependence analysis

### pick by matching which ones match your input/output variable types and numbers

## interdependent multivariate analysis

### factor analysis

1.  understand which variables highly correlate to others

    1.  common factor analysis - extracts factors that correlate

    2.  principal component analysis - extract factors that have the
        largest impact

2.  clusterananlysis

3.  multidimensional scaling

    1.  obtain tabluar data from a weighted graph structure?

4.  corresponding analysis

    1.  like factor analysis or something?

## important matrices

### data matrix

### USSCP

1.  data matrix multiplied by the transpose

### some other thing CSSCP

### covariance matrix (C)

### correlation matrix (R)

1.  variables normalized for mean 0 and stddev 1

## applications

### lots of fields
