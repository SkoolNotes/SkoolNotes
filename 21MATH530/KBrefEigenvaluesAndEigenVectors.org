** linear algebra done right (Axler 5.A)
* motivation
  The simplest non-trivial invariant subspaces are one-dimensional. Let $U$ be a one-dimensional invariant subspace under $T$, then
  \[ Tu \in U : u \in U \]
  Because $U = \text{span} (u)$, this implies
  \[ Tu = \lambda u \]
  which defines an eigenvalue ($\lambda$) and eigenvector($u$) pair.
* eigenvalue                                                            :def:
  #+begin_quote
  Suppose $T \in \mathcal L(V)$. A number $\lambda \in \mathbb F$ is called an /eigenvalue/ of $T$ if there exists $v \in V$ s.t. $v \neq 0$ and $Tv = \lambda v$.

** results
*** Axler5.6 equivalent conditions
	When $V$ is finite-dimensional, $T \in \mathcal L(V)$ and $\lambda \in F$,

***** $T - \lambda I$ is not ijnective

***** $T - \lambda I$ is not surjective

***** $T - \lambda I$ is not invertible

***** we don't want $T - \lambda I$ to be invertible because we want it to be zero  (rearranging the prev equation) :intuit:

* eigenvector                                                           :def:

  Suppose $T$ \in \mathcal L(V)$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb F$ is an eigenvalue of $T$. A vector $v \in V$ is called an /eigenvector/ of $T$ corresponding to $\lambda$ if $v \neq 0$ and $Tv = \lambda v$.

** intuit                                                            :intuit:
   $v$ can't be zero because that would be trivial. Otherwise, this is just terminology based on the prev definition: if it gets scaled but stays in the same space, then its called an eigenvector. Note that each eigenvalue $\lambda$ has a whole $\text{span}v$ of associated eigenvectors.

** results

*** equivalent condition
	#+begin_quote
	Because $Tv = \lambda v$ iff $\left(T-\lambda I\right)v = 0$ (algebra), a vector $v \in V$ with $v \neq 0$ is an eigenvector of $T$ corresponding to $\lambda$ iff $v \in \text{null}\left(T-\lambda I\right)$
