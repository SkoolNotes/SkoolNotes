* Axler5.21 Complex Vector Spaces have atleast one eigenvalue
  #+begin_quote
  Every operator on a finite-dimensional, nonzero, complex vector space has an eigenvalue.
  #+end_quote
* intuition
** by the fundamental theorem of algebra, the characteristic polynomial will have roots and thus there will be eigenvalues.
* proof
** by factoring, we turn the polynomial of maps into a composition of linear maps of the form $(T-\lambda I)$ and the input vector has to go to all of them. We choose a $v$ s.t. it should be equal to zero, which means that one of the maps needs to send the $v$ to zero (and that map will be injective and that lambda will be an eigenvalue).
** to formalize the "one of the maps sends the input to zero," you can just use a prev proof "if a chain of maps is not injective, then one of the maps is not injective" or induct because there is a finite number of maps.
