#+begin_quote
Suppose $T \in  \mathcal{L}(V)$ and $U$ is a subspace of $V$. Prove that $U$ is invariant under $T$ iff $U^\bot$ is invariant under $T^*$.
#+end_quote

For all $u \in  U$, $Tu = u' \in  U$.
Let $w = U^\perp$. Then, $T^*w = $
\[\begin{aligned}
 \langle u, T^*w \rangle = \langle Tu, w \rangle = \langle u', w \rangle
\end{aligned}\]

For all pairs $u \in  U$ and $w \in  U^\perp$,

\[\begin{aligned}
 \langle Tu, w \rangle = 0\\
 \langle u, T^*w \rangle = 0
\end{aligned}\]

This implies that the range of $T^*\BigR|_{U^\perp} \subseteq U^\perp$, aka that $T^*$ is invariant under $U^\perp$

This implies both directions, since $U = U^{\perp ^\perp }$ and $T = (T^*)^*$.
