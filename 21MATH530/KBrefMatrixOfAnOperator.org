  #+begin_quote
  Suppose $T \in  \mathcal{L} (V)$ and $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ is a basis of $V$. The /matrix of $T$/ wrt this basis is the /n/-by-/n/ matrix
  \[\begin{aligned}
  \mathcal{M} (T) = \begin{pmatrix}A_{1,1} & \cdots & A_{1, n} \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ A_{n, 1} & \cdots & A_{n, n} \end{pmatrix}
  \end{aligned}\]
  whose entries $A_{j, k}$ are defined by
  \[\begin{aligned}
  Tv_k = A_{1, k}v_1 + \cdots + A_{n,k}v_n
  \end{aligned}\]

  Specify a basis with $\mathcal{M} \left( T, (v_1, \ldots, v_n) \right)$

** intuition
*** each column is where the map takes a basis vector
* Simplifying The Matrix Representation
** 'A central goal of linear algebra is to show that given an operator $T \in  \mathcal{L} (V)$, there exists a basis of $V$ wrt which $T$ has a reasonably simple matrix'
** If by simple we mean "has many zeros" or RREF, then we know enough to ensure that there exists a basis s.t. the first column has zeros everywhere except the first row.

   \[\begin{aligned}
   \begin{pmatrix}\lambda &&&\\0&*&&\\\vdots&&&\\0&&&\end{pmatrix}
   \end{aligned}\]
