* adjoint, $T^*$                                                        :def:
  #+begin_quote
  Suppose $T \in \mathcal L(V, W). The /adjoint/ of $T$ is the function $T^* : W \to  V$ s.t.
  \[\begin{aligned}
   \langle Tv, w \rangle = \langle v, T^* w \rangle
  \end{aligned}\]

  Apparently there's another meaning for 'adjoint' in linear algebra too, but it's not covered here.

  This definition makes sense because of the [[file:KBrefLinearFunctional.org][Riesz Representation Theorem]]... :question:

  Adjoints are kind of like complex conjugates, as seen in [[file:KBrefConjugateTranspose.org][Axler 7.10]]

* results

** Useful technique: 'flip $T^*$ from one side of an inner product to become $T$ on the other side'
   You can always do this by definition of adjoint.

** Axler7.5 the adjoint is a linear map

   #+begin_quote
   If $T \in   \mathcal{L} (V, W)$, then $T^* \in  \mathcal{L} (W, V)$.

** Axler7.6 Properties of the adjoint

*** $(S+T)^* = S^* + T^*$ for all $S, T \in  \mathcal{L}(V, W)$

*** $(\lambda T)^* = \overline{\lambda}  T^*$ for all $\lambda \in  \mathbb{F}$ and $T \in  \mathcal{L} (V, W)$

*** $(T^*)^* = T$ for all $T \in  L(V, W)$

*** $I^* = I$

*** $(ST)^* = T*S*$ for all $T \in \mathcal{L} (V, W)$ and $S \in  \mathcal{L} (W, U)$ where $U$ is an inner product space over $\mathbb{F}$

** Axler7.7 null space and range of $T^*$

   Suppose $T \in  \mathcal{L}(V, W)$. Then,

*** $\onull T^* = (\orange T)^\bot$

*** $\orange T^* = (\onull T)^\bot$

*** $\onull T = (\orange T^*)^\bot$

*** $\orange T = (\onull T^*)^\bot$
