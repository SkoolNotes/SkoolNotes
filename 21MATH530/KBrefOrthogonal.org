  #+begin_quote
  Two vectors $u, v \in V$ are called /orthogonal/ if $\langle u, v \rangle = 0$

* results
** orthogonal ~= perpendicular
** Axler 6.12 orthogonality and zero
*** 0 is orthogonal to every vector in $V$
*** 0 is the only vector in $V$ that is orthogonal to itself
** Axler 6.13 Pythagorean Theorem
   #+begin_quote
   Suppose $u$ and $v$ are orthogonal vectors in $V$. Then
   \[\begin{aligned}
   \lVert u+v \rVert^2 = \lVert u \rVert^2 + \lVert v \rVert^2
   \end{aligned}\]
