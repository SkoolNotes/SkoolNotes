# Special Relativity

* If events are apart for observers to see, two observers have to record the time and compare notes
* It will take time (sound/light) from an event to get from the event to the observer; the travel time needs to be taken into account, and if the objects are moving, calculating time travel would be extremely tricky
* Human senses also have certanty
