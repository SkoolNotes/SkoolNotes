# Sense and Antisense DNA/RNA

| Type | Identifier | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| DNA 3'...5' | DNA Antisense/Noncoding/Template Strand | Used as a template for transcription |
| DNA 5'...3' | DNA Sense/Coding/Nontemplate Strand | The complement to the template strand + what is being used (bar urisil) in RNA form to perform protein synthesis |
| RNA 3'...5' | mRNA Antisense/-ss Strand | Pretty useless (unless you are trying to avoid detection) RNA strand that serve only as the template for the RNA that codes for a protein |
| RNA 5'...3' | mRNA Sense/+ss Strand | RNA transcribed from the template antisense strand that codes for a protein |
