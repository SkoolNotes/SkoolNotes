***
Firstly, LDF.

Pentaine => Carbon-Carbon bonds has 0 EN difference w/ even distribution of electrons

* Electrons are randomly within their 3D shape
* So, when electrons are accidentally concentrated, a dipole moment will temporarily form 
***

* Pentaine!
    * Non polar
    * Only have LDF
    * So, water's dipole moment isn't very attractive anymore
    * Larger surface area of pentain makes it happier bonding with each other instead of water (more LDF opportunities with bigger surface area of pentain)
* Definition: lipids — dominantly hydrophobic biological molecules ("fats")

Single fatty acids

* Fatty acids — Glycerol
* Fat (a.k.a. adapose tissue) – Trglycerol (3) — 3 gl
* Saturated vs. unsaturated fats
    * No Double bonds in left carbon chain: saturated fats, (butter)
    * Double bonds in left carbon chain: unsaturated fats, (olive oil)
* A question: given that saturated fats have no double bonds, why does it melt later then the unsaturated fats?
    * Double bonds, due to their caused VESPR geometry (and hence the -1 hydrogen), are curved. This makes it harder to stack together, causing a lower melting point
    * Single bonds, due to their caused VESPR geometry, is flat. This makes them easier to stack together, causing a higher melting point.
    
Phosolipids = 2 fatty acids + phosphate group

Many of these will end up with membrane

* Head hydrophobic
* Tail hydrophillic
* Causes a string
