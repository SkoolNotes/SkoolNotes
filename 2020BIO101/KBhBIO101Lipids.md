# Lipids

## Pentaine 

![pentane-plus-market-400x225.png](./pentane-plus-market-400x225.png)

A non-polar molecule that build up the fundamentals of lipids.

* Non polar
* Will only have LDF
* Hydrophobic
    * Because it is non polar, will only have LDF
    * So, water's dipole moment makes it not attractive to pentaine
    * Large surface area of pentaine will result in more LDF (bigger surface area => more opportunities to LDF), so pentaines will more likely to LDF with other pentains if given the choice between pentain vs. water

***

**and now, a note on LDF**

Pentaine => Carbon-Carbon bonds has 0 EN difference w/ even distribution of electrons

* Electrons are randomly within their 3D shape
* So, when electrons are accidentally concentrated, a dipole moment will temporarily form 

***

## And now, actually lipids

Lipids are built up from peintaine molecules. You could also take many of these lipids + other elements to build up more complicated, hydrophobic/phillic structures.
