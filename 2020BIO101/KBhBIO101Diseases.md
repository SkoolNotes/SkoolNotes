# Diseases, an overview
\definition{**Disease**}{an abnormal condition that causes impairment in/loss of function of an organism (a.k.a. decreased fitness) that is not due to immediate external injury.}

## Causes of Disease
* Infectious agents
* Deficiency disorders
* Heritable factors
* Physiological disorders (immunodeficiency, autoimmune disorders, allergies, etc.)

## Types of Diseases
### Congenital Disease
Diseases present at birth due to DNA abnormalities / pregnancy pathological issues

### Acquired Disease
Diseases that begin during the lifetime due to exposure to some environmental factors...

- **Microrganism Invasion** => "infectious disease"
- **Autoimmune reaction** => your body fighting your body
- **Nutrient deficiency** => not eating good
- **Mechanical wear** => wear and tear of physical body parts
- **Ingestion of noxious chemicals** => eating poison

***
An aside...

**Infectious diseases actually smaller on the causes of death in the US**

* Heart disease => wear + deficiency 
* Cancer => heritable + DNA
* Unintentional injuries => not a disease
* Chronic respitory disease => wear
* Stroke => not a disease
* Alhetimer disease => wear
* Diabetes => autoimmune, nutrient, wear
* Influenca <= **here, finally, an infections disease.**
***

## Disease-causing Agents
* **Protozoan** => single-celled eukaryotes
* **Fungal** => single/multi-celled eukarotyes
* **Bacteria** => single-celled prokaryotes
* **Viral** => acellular parasitic infectious agent
* **Helminuthus** => multicellular worms
* **Prions** => acellular misfolded proteins
* **Viroids** => infections nucleic acids w/o protein coat to make virus

### Protozoan

* **Protozoan factors** => direction pathogenisis leading to tissue damage
* **Host-mediated factors** => immune evation + escape mechnisms + immunalsupression

Adaptable!!

### Fungal

* **Fungal factors** => many shapes and very adaptable, colud produced specialized enzymes to take root in body
* **Host-mediated factors** => cause immunocomprimzation, acquired though inhalation, etc.

### Bacteria

* **Bacterial-induced toxicity** => produces toxins + has hard capsule cell
* **Host-mediated factors** => may develop host resistance, could compete for resources, and could be grown introcellularly
