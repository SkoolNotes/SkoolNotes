# Cell Membrains
- Variety of components
- Suspended in "fluid mosaic"
- Phosopholipids in fluid mosaic
    - Charged head
    - Nonpolar tail
    - "bi layer"
- Also includes…
    - Colestrol
        - Cells communicates 
    - Proteans
        - Makes sure the right molecules gets in/out
        - Nonpolar Oxygen + CO2 could easily get through
        - Polar and charged molecules can't get through, unless...
        - Channeled proteins let specific polar particles through
- Cell Transport => how chemicals get in + out of the cell
    - Passive diffusion
        - Passive Passive diffusions => nonpolar things simply "fall in"
        - Facillitated diffusions => polar molecules selectively get throgh protean channels
        - Active transport
            - ATP sheperds elements in  
        - Bulk transport across the plasma membrane occurs by exocytosis and endocytosis.
