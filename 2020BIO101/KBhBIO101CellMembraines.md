# Cell Membrane

## Fluid mosaic model of cell membrane
This is a lovely model for a potential way that cell membrane transport could happen. It is also the most (?) commonly accepted model.

See [[KBhBIO101FluidMosaic]]

# Cell Transport

How chemicals get in + out of the cell

**Passive diffusion**

"Passiveâ€¦ Passive Diffusion": Non-Polar things simply "fall in" in the direction of chemical gradient

"Facilitated Diffusion": polar molecules selectively get through protean channels

**Active diffusion**

"Active transport": ATP shepherds elements in  

"Bulk transport": 

- Large item transport across the plasma membrane
- Transport vesicles brakes off membrane to receive elements, recycled back later
- Exocytosis and Endocytosis
