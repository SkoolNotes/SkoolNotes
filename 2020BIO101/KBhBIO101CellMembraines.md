# Cell Membrane
## Fluid mosaic model

Some Phosopholipids connected as a "phosolipid bi-layer" (see [[KBhBIO101StructuresOfLipids]] structure 

- Charged head
- Nonpolar tail

So, head aligns and tail aligns, creating the basic structure of the membrane:

### Stuff in the membrane

Colestrol 
        - Cells communicates 
    - Proteans
        - Makes sure the right molecules gets in/out
        - Nonpolar Oxygen + CO2 could easily get through
        - Polar and charged molecules can't get through, unless...
        - Channeled proteins let specific polar particles through
- Cell Transport => how chemicals get in + out of the cell
    - Passive diffusion
        - Passive Passive diffusions => nonpolar things simply "fall in"
        - Facillitated diffusions => polar molecules selectively get throgh protean channels
        - Active transport
            - ATP sheperds elements in  
        - Bulk transport across the plasma membrane occurs by exocytosis and endocytosis.Â
