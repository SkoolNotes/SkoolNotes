# Cell Membrane

See [[KBhBIO101FluidMosaic]]

### Cell Transport
How chemicals get in + out of the cell

**Passive diffusion**

"Passiveâ€¦ Passive Diffusion": Non-Polar things simply "fall in" in the direction of chemical gradient

"Facilitated Diffusion": polar molecules selectively get through protean channels

**Active diffusion**

"Active transport": ATP shepherds elements in  

"Bulk transport": 

- Large item transport across the plasma membrane
- Transport vesicles attaches to membrane to receive elements
- Exocytosis and Endocytosis
