# Organizing Organelles Based on Membranes

By organizing [[KBhBIO101EukaryoticOrganells]] based on whether or not they have membranes, it helps us gauge the evolutionary history of cells.

## Membranous Organelles
These have membranes! They have their own plasma, regulates their own macromolecule consumption, hormones, etc. Based on [[KBhBIO101Endosymbiotic]] endosymbiotic theory, these may perhaps be the organelles that were originally independent prokaryotic cells that evolve to coexist with Eukarotes.



### Double Membranes
* Mitochrondria => store ATP and extract energy from ATP
* Chloroplasts => Does photosynthesis

### Double Membranes, Evolved Later
*  Endoplasmic reticulum => forms the network of transferring proteins and other elements
*  Golgi body/Gioli apparatus => packs, sorts, and modifies proteins and other elements throughout the cell
