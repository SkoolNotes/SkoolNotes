# Alright, let's talk about water.

## Intra-Molecular water bonds

* As we know (or looked up from the PTable)
* Hydrogen has electronegativity of 2.20, and oxygen has EN 3.44
* The difference >0.4 <1.7 makes these bonds **polar covalent**

See [[KBhBIO101BondingReview]], bonding review

## Why is ice less dense? 
* Freezing usually bring new ordering of molecules to make it paced
* But! Not the case for normal water because of hydrogen bond
    * Strong 6-ring Hydrogen bonds in ice prevents shrinking
    * Empty space filled with air, making it less dense

### Why do I care?
Ice floats! Causing beautiful ice effects that the ecosystem uses

* Pseudo-landmass
    * Antarctica
    * Animal habitat
* Ice reflect incoming light ("albeto")
    * Bounces energy off
    * Cools the water

## Inter-Molecular water bonds properties

See [[KBhBIO101PropsOfWater]], properties of water.

# So, why is water the chosen liquid?

See also [[KBhBIO101PropsOfWater]] Properties of Water

* Liquid at Earth temperatures
* Sticky => strong bonds that help water hold together + resist change in temperature (hence why AlcaholLand cannot exist).
    * Varing te 
* Is universal solvent
