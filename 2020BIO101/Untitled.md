####  What two alleles could a person with blood type A have? With type B? With type AB? With type O?
- **A**: *AA, AO*
- **B**: *BB, BO*
- **AB**: *AB*
- **O**: *OO*

####  If a person with type AB blood had a child with a type O person, what possible blood types could their child have? What would be the likelihood of each type?
A + B, O + O:
- A + O -> A
- B + O -> B

**50% A, 50% B**

#### If the offspring from the previous question grew up to have a child with a type AB person, what blood types could their child potentially have?
O+A||B, A+B:
- O + A -> A
- O + B -> B
- A + A -> A
- B + B -> B
- A + B -> A+B
- B + A -> A+B

**1/3 A, 1/3 B, 1/3 A + B**
