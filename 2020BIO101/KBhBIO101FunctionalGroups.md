# Functional Groups of Biology
- Alcohol Group: H-O-R (part of the Carboxyl when R=C, as in H-O-C)
- Carbonyl: C=O (part of carboxyl)
- Carboxyl/Carboxylic Acid: H-O-C=O  (left side of backbone) ![[Screen Shot 2020-10-12 at 2.29.28 PM]]
- Amino/amine — H3N+ (right side of backbone)
- Amide — RC(=O)NR′R″ (frequently shown in side chains of amino acids — see [Amine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amide#/media/File:Amide-general.png))
- Ether: R-O-R (structure of glycocidic bonds formed by dehydration)
- Ester: R-O-C-O (structure that joins fatty acid and glycerol together)
- Hydroxyl: OH group. Need I say more?
