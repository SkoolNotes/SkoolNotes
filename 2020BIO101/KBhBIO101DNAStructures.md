# DNA Structures
* **DNA double helix**: the unwrapped, raw DNA pre-bundling or formation of any structures.
* **Nucleosomes**: a stack of 2 _histone_ groups to create a spool of 8 histone proteins wrapping DNA
	* Histones => coiler proteins that DNA wraps around to form more advanced structures
	* Each group of histones contains 4 parts (hence 4 (per group) x 2 (groups) = 8 histones)
		* H3, H4, H2a, H2b are the 4 wrapping proteins
		* H1 is the histone that seals the group of 4 together
* **Chromatin**: wrapping nucleosomes into a large, fiberous structure
* **Chromasome**: the entangling
