# DNA Structures
## DNA double helix
The unwrapped, raw DNA pre-bundling or formation of any structures.

## Nucleosomes
A stack of 2 _histone_ groups to create a spool of 8 histone proteins wrapping DNA

## Histones
Coiler proteins that DNA wraps around to form more advanced structures

* Each group of histones contains 4 parts (hence 4 (per group) x 2 (groups) = 8 histones)
	* H3, H4, H2a, H2b are the 4 wrapping proteins
	* H1 is the histone that seals the group of 4 together

## Chromatin
Wrapping nucleosomes into a large, fiberous structure

## Chromasome
The entangling 2 chromatin together. This is the structure that is split in half during cell replication
