# DNA Structures
* **DNA double helix**: the unwrapped, raw DNA pre-bundling or formation of any structures.
* **Nucleosomes**: a stack of 2 _histone_ groups to create a spool of 8 histone proteins wrapping DNA
	* Histones => coiler proteins that DNA wraps around to form more advanced structures
	* Each group of histones contains 4 parts (hence 4  (per2=8)
