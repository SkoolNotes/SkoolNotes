# Macromolecules

## Scales
**Macromolecules**: Measured on the scale of picometres. Extremely small + at atomic scales.

**Macromolecule Structure**: Measured on the scale of nanometres.

**Organelles + Viruses**: Measured on the scales of hundreds of nanometers

**Cells + Bacteria**: Measured on the scales of micrometers

## "Small Molecules" vs. "Macromelecules"
* Small molecules — < 30-40 atoms
* Macromolecules — > 30-40 atoms, joined by polymerization or just, are, big
