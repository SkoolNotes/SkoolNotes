- Where do we get our amino acids?
	- Meat protein is "better" than plant protein 
		- because it has all the amino acids
- Active site
	- How {R groups and cofactors (like metal elemetns (like magnesium)), polarity / electroneg difference} facilatate new bond formation
		- DNA Polymerase's active site: [[bioSRCdnaPolymeraseAciveSite.png]]
			- R groups (Asp) have the negative charges that create weak (pink) bonds with magnesium which holds the DNA monomer
				- DNA monomer comes with a triple phosphate attached (brings its own energy)
