1. > How many grams of protein do you want/need per day? What sources are you using for this determination?

It seems like 0.8 g per kg of human male is the accepted RDI. [Harvard Health Blog](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-every-day-201506188096), [verywell fit](https://www.verywellfit.com/how-to-calculate-how-much-protein-you-need-3955709), [healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-protein-per-day)

2.  > What is your preferred animal:plant protein ration and why? (essential amino acids, environmental)

I don't have a strong preference on what my preferred ratio is, especially because I don't pay too much attention to what I eat. I don't particularly like eating food, and I don't particularly like eating meat, so I think I could go for a more environmentally friendly ratio, because even "overdosing" on some amino acids to hit the rarer ones RDI would be less environmentally impactful than eating more meat.

4. > Cross check the https://www.myfooddata.com (Links to an external site.) essential amino acid values/food with the tables in the slides (Links to an external site.). Do they seem consistent? Provide evidence for you answer.

 5. > Were there any essential amino acids, vitamins, or minerals needs that were challenging to satisfy during your meal planning?   What are some foods particularly high in that vitamin or mineral?
