# Entropy

#flo #disorganized 	

Startistical measure of randomness in a reaction of systems. 

Entropy measured in microstates â€” the Greater numbers of microstates means that there is more entropy

To think about this, think about states of matter:

- Gas => Most Entropy
- Water => Meh Entropy
- Solids => Least Entropy

In this image, states (a) and (e) are least likely. This is because **the greater the spread, the greater the entropy; systems like to have an increase of entropic state as much as it is possible.**

\definition{Second Law of Thermodynamics}{In the universe, entropy is increasing.}
