# Experiment Design
### Mechanistic Understanding
 - Once data has been collected, it is important that one tries to get a mechanistic understanding.
	 - This means more why this pattern is occurring.
### Data vs Theory
 - Evidence is very different from theory.
	 - Evidence may describe a pattern, but as soon as any theory or interpretation is applied it
		 - One of De's mentors called this religion vs evidence
	 - Example: He takes a survey that has us all saying that we feel relatively safe, but we don't feel calm and we feel stressed out
		 - With this data you can draw two conclusions
			 - We are in a world where we are stressed
			 - We are a world where we aren't stressed
		 - There has to be one or the other
			 - The evidence supports the first one, but one cannot prove anything
 - The pattern is an extrapolation of the data
	 - It's considered religion
