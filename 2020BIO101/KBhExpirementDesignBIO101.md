# Experiment Design
### Mechanistic Understanding
 - Once data has been collected, it is important that one tries to get a mechanistic understanding.
	 - This means more why this pattern is occurring.
### Data vs Theory
 - Evidence is very different from theory.
	 - Evidence may describe a pattern, but as soon as any theory or interpretation is applied it
