# Molecular Dynamics 

H02 to S02 --  water to sulfur-dioxide 

Line represent polar attraction? Hydrogen bonds? 

> has a lot to do with electronegativity



# Free-write Start 

- What do you notice about the difference in movement between H20 and S02? Why is this?
	-	

- Described what the emergent lines between the atoms represent? 
	-	I believe those ere hydrogen bonds, 

- What is there to possibly know about water? How does water support life? 

- What are biological implications of waterâ€™s properties?
