** Self assembly

** Construction

** Fatty acids
    - caboxylic acid
    - fatty part is a hydrocarbon
    - connected to the head by an ester linkage using a dehydration synthesis reaction
    - energy storage molecule

*** Saturation vs unsaturated
    - If it's saturated, then everything lines up nicely
    - unsaturated fatty acids have a kink (carbon doublebond)
        - harder to pack and flow more smoothly

** Phospholipids
   - like normal lipids but with a mmore polar head
   - one saturated tail and one unsaturated tail
