** Self assembly

** Construction

** Fatty acids
    - caboxylic acid
    - fatty part is a hydrocarbon
    - connected to the head by an ester linkage using a dehydration synthesis reaction
    - energy storage molecule

*** Saturation vs unsaturated
    - If it's saturated, then everything lines up nicely
    - unsaturated fatty acids have a kink (carbon doublebond)
        - harder to pack and flow more smoothly

** Phospholipids
   - like normal lipids but with a mmore polar head
   - one saturated tail and one unsaturated tail
   - bilayers separate water from outside and inside

*** Assembly
    - Liposome: bilayer, hydrophilic inside, layer of hydrophobic tails
    - Micelle: one layer, hydrophobic inside

**** Assembly structure depends on pH
      - High pH = low protons available
        - thus, the charged head is negatively ionized
        - Thus, the hydrophobic tails attract eachother by water exclusion and charged heads repel eachother
      - pH around 8.5 means half and half, which means that charged heads are likely to attract eachother
