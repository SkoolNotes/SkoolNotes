# Antiviral Drugs
Let's talk about **Remdesivir**! A drug developed by Pfizer that's used to combat Ebola + influenza viral replication.

 Modified nucleotide triphosphate which adds onto the RNA strand copied by the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase carried by viruses
 
* Pretends + gets inserted as a nucleotide
* Once added onto the RNA chain, jams further actual nucleotides from being inserted

 _Could_ but usually does not jam up normal RNA polymerase which does normal transcription (which is why they must be hospital-administered)
 
* Inhibiting transcription in the short term won't kill you immediately
* So, we hurt normal cell transcription a little in order to rid of the virus
* Need hospital treatment for regular and safe dosing for this exact reason
