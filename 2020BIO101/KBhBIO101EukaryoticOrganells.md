# Organelles in Eukaryotic Cells

## An Introduction.
Many organells exist in a cell — often more in Eukaryotic cells — that help execute the cell's functions. They serve a variety of purposes, and help form the basics of cellular systems. Categorizing them based on whether or not they have membranes [[KBhBIO101OrganellsBasedOnMembranes]]

## Chloroplast and Mitochondria
* **Chloroplast** — found in plants + does photosynthesis
* **Mitochondria** — found in animals + store ATP and extract energy from ATP

## Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and Smooth ER	
* **Rough ER** — covered by ribosomes and folds [[KBhBIO101Proteins]] proteins
* **Smooth ER** — not covered by ribosomes and makes [[KBhBIO101Lipids]] lipids

## Ribosomes and Golgi apparatus
* **Ribosomes** => synthesizes proteins
* **Golgi apparatus** => packs, modifying, and moving proteins 

## Cell Wall and Plasma Membrane
* **Cell Wall** — found in plants => surround the cell: hard
* **Plasma membrane** — found in animals => surround the cell: soft [[KBhBIO101Lipids]] lipids

## Cytosol, Cytoplasm and Cytoskeleton
* **Cytosol** => liquid found inside cells; the "cytoplasm" floats within it
* **Cytoplasm** => all the stuff within the cell

## Nucleus and Nucleolus
* **Nucleus** => centre of the cell, stores DNA
* **Nucleolus** => largest part of the nucleous that makes ribosomes

## Lysosomes and Food Vacuoles
* **Lysosomes** => vesticles that contains enzymes that breaks down biomolecules
* **Food Vacoules** => vesticels that stores food and other resources

## Cytoskeleton and Microtubules
* **Cytoskeleton** => complex network of proteins + fibres that organize the rest of the cell
* **Microtubulues** => Polymers of tubulin protein that provides the main structure of eukarotic cells 

## Flagella and Cilia 
* **Flagella** => a bacteria's tail — allow them to move and also act as an sensory organ. longer than a cilla, and moves in sinosoidial pattern.
* **Cilium** => a cell's "hair" — provides sensory and communications functions. Motil cilla could move about to "grab" things, and non-motile cilla can't move. more abundant that the flagella, and moves in circular pattern if they do move, and moves in circular pattern if they do move
