# Enzymes
Proteins that build things up and break things down! 

A macromolecular **catalyst**, it...

1. Speeds up the rate of reactions
2. Does not get consumed by the reaction
	1. Not a fundimental product
	2. Not a fundiment reactant
3.  Shape determines the reactions that it can participate in
4.  Enzymes are subject to **protean denaturation** => if the protein unfolds, its function will be lost. Triggered by excess heat, acid, and other problems

(4) is unlike non-protein, inorganic catalyst â€” inorganic non-proteins need to unwrap or wrap.
