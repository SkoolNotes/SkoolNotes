# Cell Membrane Protean Transports 
## Simple Diffusion
Due to the wonderful nature of **ENTROPY!!!**, a

## Passive diffusion
- **Passiveâ€¦ Passive Diffusion**: Non-Polar things simply "fall in" in the direction of chemical gradient
- **Facilitated Diffusion**: polar molecules selectively get through protean channels

## Active diffusion
- **Active transport**: ATP shepherds elements in  
- **Bulk transport**
    - Large item transport across the plasma membrane
    - Transport vesicles brakes off membrane to receive elements, recycled back later
    - Exocytosis and Endocytosis
