# Cell Membrane Protean Transports 
## Simple Diffusion
Due to the wonderful nature of **ENTROPY!!!**, things just tend to spread out from high to low concentrations.

## Passive diffusion
- **Passiveâ€¦ Passive Diffusion**: Non-Polar things simply "fall in" in the direction of chemical gradient
- **Facilitated Diffusion**: polar molecules selectively get through protean channels
- **Osmosis**: facilitated diffusion of water through a membrane

## Active diffusion
- **Active transport**: ATP shepherds elements in  
- **Bulk transport**
    - Large item transport across the plasma membrane
    - Transport vesicles brakes off membrane to receive elements, recycled back later
    - Exocytosis and Endocytosis
