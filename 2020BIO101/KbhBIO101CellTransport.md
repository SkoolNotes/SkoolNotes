# Cell Membrane Protean Transports 
## Simple Diffusion
Due to the wonderful nature of **ENTROPY!!!**, things just tend to spread out from high to low concentrations.

## Passive diffusion
- **Passive… Passive Diffusion**: Non-Polar things simply "fall in" in the direction of chemical gradient
- **Facilitated Diffusion**: polar molecules selectively get through protean channels
- **Osmosis**: facilitated diffusion of water through a membrane

***

Quick ad break for some terms on Osmosis

* **Isotonic** => inside and outside have the same level of "osmolarity": probablility for osmosis to happen through a semipermiable membrane
* **Hypertonic** => inside has less osmolarity than the outside: water/other elems will flow out of the cell
* **Hypotonic** => outside has less osmolarity than the inside: water/other elems will flow into the cell

## Active diffusion
ATP shepherds elements in  

## Bulk transport
* **Phagocytosis** => take a piece of the membrane with you to form a vesticle to introduce large solid elements, recycling the membrane after done — "cell eating"
* **Pinocytosis** => take a piece of the membrane with you to form a vesticle to introduce large area of the "outside" in — fluid and solid and all, recycling the membrane after done — "cell drinking"
* **Endocytosis** => Phagocytosis + Pinocytosis
* **Extocytosis** => opposite of endocytosis
