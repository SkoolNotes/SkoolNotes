# So, let's do biology
**What makes Biology different?**

* Less predictable
    * Less laws + more entropy
    * Changing systems
* Different scales
* Organisms
    * Different genius
    * Unique constitution
* Wider range + more noticiable — on the "scale" of humans
* Emergent properties over time, not static
* Moving target of study

> Biology is undergoing a serious revolution at the moment...

## Biology's Guiding Principles
1. Simple set of rules dictates self-assembling of systems
2. Units of order/structure contributes to biological system
3. Instructions + rules governing structure and order built into self-contained units that comprise bigger systems
4. Biological systems has many rules of structure that drive changes to behaviorial and changes to rules themselves

## Life's levels of organization
1. Biosphere
2. Ecosystems
3. Communities
4. Populations
5. Organisms
6. Tissue 
7. Cells
8. Organelles
9. Molecules


**"Biology", in the most reductionistic sense, is quite deterministic.**

But! This is changing. A new field of "systems biology" now includes new understanding and methods to track "rules" across all organizations, and thinking of the whole system, well, as a whole, which of course introduces changes that make biology less deterministic.

# Course Aftercare
* Luke De added to the Biology Team
    * Teaching 2 Bio classes
    * Fill time
* Trip Sweeney 

## Class systems + structures
* Class Canvas Page
    * Resources — textbooks, templates, and essential class information **should probably read these!!**
        * One book has an AP Biology focus
        * The other has a more holistic focus
        * Optional readings may be pulcked from both
        * _Tip: download these_
    * Luke's videos
        * Templates
        * Class expectations
        * Course structures
        * "The boring stuff"
    * One-on-one meetings: *Friday tutorial*
    * "Flipped learning" methods employed for instruction
