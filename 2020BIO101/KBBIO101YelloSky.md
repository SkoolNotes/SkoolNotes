# What's up with the weather today?

* Land heats up quickly, water does not heat up as quickly due to specific heat capacity difference
* Results in big land-to-ocean differential
* Water vapor gets trapped on land because of temperature differential
* Smoke is trapped above marine layer
* Sadness!


* Normal force to lift smoke away is to lift wind up
* Given that the wind is absent, gravity pulls cloud layer down
*
