Honor Code

I, Huxley Marvit, affirm that I will only utilize the internet during this assessment for the purpose of accessing my class notes and documents linked on the class Canvas site. I will close all other internet browser windows before beginning the assessment. I will not use any other resources, including using search engines to look up terms. I will not discuss the assessment with anyone but Jehnna, including after it’s completed. If I am confused about wording or terminology used on the assessment, I will reference the allowed materials and/or ask Jehnna to clarify by sending a private zoom message to her. I agree that I will learn best by authentically engaging with the assessment rather than searching for answers on the internet or from my friends. I understand that I will be offered a reassessment opportunity if I need it. I affirm that I, Huxley Marvit, have read this honor code and will abide by it. 




1. PKU

## 1
##### A
mom: pp, dad: PP
pP -> P
In any combination, their would not be two mutant PAH alleles. Thus, the child would have a 0% chance of having the disorder. 

##### B
child: pP, partner: pp	
	
pp, (p1p1) -> p
pp, (p1p2) -> p
Pp, (Pp1) -> P
Pp, (Pp2) -> P
	
50% chance of having PKU disorder	

1. **A promoter mutation that reduces expression of PAH protein to 50% of normal levels.**
	1. Given that "classic PKU" results from near complete loss of PAH function, a 50% loss would most likely be classified as "mild PKU"

2. **A missense mutation that changes an amino acid in the PAH enzyme’s active site, preventing any phenylalanine from binding there.**
	1. This would completely inhibit PAH function, leading to "classic PKU"

3.  **A frameshift mutation very early in the coding sequence of the PAH gene.**
	1.  A frameshift mutation early on would cause almost the entire sequence to be translated incorrectly. Most likely, this would lead to near complete loss of function, and thus, "classic PKU"

4. **A missense mutation that changes an amino acid in an allosteric site (an enzyme site that is not directly involved in breaking down phenylalanine), leading to a 40% reduction in the rate of enzyme activity.**
	1. 40% reduction is not near-complete, and thus would most likely be classified as "mild PKU"


## 2

##### A
Most woman have two X chromosomes, whereas most men have a X chromosome and a Y chromosome. Since hemophilia is located on the X chromosome, in men, it doesn't have a chance to not be dominated.

##### B

For the woman to be healthy and have any hemophilia-associated alleles, they must have a singular recessive mutation.

Somatic cells, carrying 23 pairs of chromosomes, have all the genetic information which is all copied by mitosis. Thus, they will contain the hemophilia-associated allele.
