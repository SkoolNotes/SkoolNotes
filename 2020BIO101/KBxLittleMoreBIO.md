Honor Code

I, Huxley Marvit, affirm that I will only utilize the internet during this assessment for the purpose of accessing my class notes and documents linked on the class Canvas site. I will close all other internet browser windows before beginning the assessment. I will not use any other resources, including using search engines to look up terms. I will not discuss the assessment with anyone but Jehnna, including after itâ€™s completed. If I am confused about wording or terminology used on the assessment, I will reference the allowed materials and/or ask Jehnna to clarify by sending a private zoom message to her. I agree that I will learn best by authentically engaging with the assessment rather than searching for answers on the internet or from my friends. I understand that I will be offered a reassessment opportunity if I need it. I affirm that I, Huxley Marvit, have read this honor code and will abide by it.
