# Context

These are lists compiled from code I wrote with a few peers, which can be found here: [Repository](https://github.com/SkoolNotes/diet-finder8000superplus)

I spent *well* over 30 minutes working on this, and I learned a lot about coding as well as data collection/management and nutrition.

The code is not currently functioning at full capacity, as we ran it on a limited dateset. However, we are currently working on making it function with a larger dateset, which will make it much more powerful. 


My apologies for the lack of a myfooddata link -- instead you are seeing this on a website my friends and I made for note-taking and knowledge sharing.
