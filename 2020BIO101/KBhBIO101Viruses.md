# Viruses
\definition{Viruses}{Acellular Macromolecular Assemblies}

Viruses...

* ...contain protein coat called capsid
* ...use DNA or RNA, but not both
* ...are obligate parasites that could only replicate within host

Assembled and mature viral particles => virions. They usually have three different parts

1. Capsid — the protein coat
2. Genetic material — what they are transmitting/replicating
3. Occationally outside lipid layer 

=> Viruses exist on the nanometre scale, but they are difference in share and size
