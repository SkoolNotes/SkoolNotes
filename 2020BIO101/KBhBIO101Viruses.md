# Viruses
\definition{Viruses}{Acellular Macromolecular Assemblies}

Viruses...

* ...contain protein coat called **capsid**
* ...use DNA or RNA, but not both
* ...are obligate parasites that could only replicate within host

Assembled and mature viral particles => **virions**. They usually have three different parts

1. Capsid — the protein coat
2. Genetic material — what they are transmitting/replicating
3. Occationally outside lipid layer 

=> Viruses exist on the nanometre scale, but they are difference in share and size

## Virus Lifecycle + Infectivity
How do viruses infect people? Basically, they come into your body, hijack the [[KBhBIO101CentralDogma]] system of your body, and leverage it to create more copies of itself. To see more about this, head on over to [[KBhBIO101ViralInfection]]
