# Viral Replication
This is the process by which the genetic material virus (and by proxy its whole) is replicated through hijacking the host cell's [[KBhBIO101CentralDogma]] processes. To investigate this, we ask two questions:

- **How are viral mRNAs produced from the viral genome?** => virus will hijack the ribosomes in the host cells. So, it is more important to ask how the mRNAs are produced to tell ribosomes what to do
- **What serves as the template for viral genome replication** => replication will need a polymeraese; but the source and mechanism is dependent on viral genome structure/composition

## For DNA Viruses
### How are viral mRNAs produced from the viral genome?
- Viral DNA enters, through RNA polymerase II in the host cell, mRNA is produced
- mRNAs then read  by ribosomes, and there we go

### What serves as the templates for viral genome replication?
- Viral DNA serves as template for host cell DNA polymerase
- Viral genome copied repeatedly
- Virus, then, **will be replicated within the nucleus** due to it needing the host polymerase to copy DNA

Except! Poxvirade viruses carry their own polymerase, so they replicate in the cytoplasm by simply entering and releasing the polymerease.

## RNA Viruses
### How are viral mRNAs produced from the viral genome?
Depends on what [[KBhBIO101SenseAndAntisense]] the viral RNA is, there are different processes

- If the virus is carrying +SS RNA, they do not need to produce anything because that is directly translatable by the host ribosomes
- If the virus is carrying -SS RNA (which is useless by itself as it is the template RNA, making it harder to detect), they would trigger the process of RNA replication either using their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerease or using that of the host cells
- If the virus is carrying both, it will infect with both +-stranded and --stranded RNA, but the latter requires conversion

### What serves as the templates for viral genome replication?
* with dsRNA; takes +ssRNA and makes -ssRMA; combining the two to produce dsRNA
* with +ssRNA, takes +ssRNA and makes temporary -ssRNA which makes more +ssRNA
* with -ssRNA, takes -ssRNA, and makes temporary +ssRNA, which makes -ssRNA

Instead of waiting for the RNA-dependent-RNA polymerease of the cell, viruses sometimes decide to just bring-your-own-polymerease to catalyze this process.
