# Types of micro (point) mutations

## insert/remove

### frameshift mutation

1.  deletion/insertion that nets a non-multiple of 3, so the codons
    don\'t line up anymore

2.  everything downstream is \"corrupted\"

## substitute

### missense mutation

1.  changes an amino acid to another amino acid

### nonsense mutation

1.  changes an amino acid to a stop codon

### silent mutation

1.  does not change an amino acid

# macro mutations

## deletion of a large chunk

## duplication of a large chunk

## inversion of a large chunk (reverses it)

## substitution (move a chunk elsewhere)

## translation?

# comparison

## micro mutations tend to happen and then cause macro mutations, both can cause cancer
