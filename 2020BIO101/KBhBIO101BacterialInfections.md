# Bacterial Infections
Induction of diseases via the entry of bacteria.

* **Bacterial-induced toxicity** => produces toxins + has hard capsule cell
* **Host-mediated factors** => may develop host resistance, could compete for resources, and could be grown introcellularly

## Biofilm formation
- Communities of bacteria could work together by adhering and exchanging information
- Bacterial could perform quorum sensing => exchange of information with each other + recognize various members of their group

## Fighting bacterial infections
**Antibiotics** => drugs with selective toxicity for specific bacterial types

Act by...

* Disrupting membrane + cell wall integrity
* Selectively target + impair bacterial ribosomes
* Block bacterial DNA replication/transcription
* Inhibit bacterial metabolism
