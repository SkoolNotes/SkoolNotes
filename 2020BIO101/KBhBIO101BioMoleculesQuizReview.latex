  Enzymes? {[}{[}KBhBIO101Enzymes{]}{]}

OK, so. Apparently Paul just answered the rest of his questions.

And I quote

"""

\textbf{Enzymes are catalysts. They speed reaction rates but do not
affect the change in free energy of the reaction (the difference in
potential energy between reactants and products).}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Activation energy is the amount of kinetic energy required to reach
  the transition state of a reaction.
\item
  Enzymes speed up a reaction by lowering the activation energy, often
  with the help of cofactors or coenzymes.
\item
  \textbf{Enzymes lower the activation energy by some combination
  of\ldots{}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Orienting the reactions substrate(s) to promote more effective
    collisions (and therefore reactions
  \item
    Stressing or straining bonds to temporarily and/or slightly lower
    the strength of attraction to allow the bond to break more easily
  \item
    Involving amino acid R-groups or sidechains in creating the
    transition state between reactants and products
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Enzymes have active sites that bring substrates together and may change
shape to stabilize the transition state; known as Induced Fit upon
binding active site and slight change in enzyme shape.

Most enzymes are proteins, and thus their activity can be directly
influenced by modifications or environmental factors, such as
temperature and pH, that alter their three-dimensional structure.

Enzyme activity may be regulated/inhibited by molecules that compete
with substrates to occupy the active site (competitive inhibitor) or
alter enzyme shape so that substrates become unable to enter the active
site (non-competitive inhibitor).
