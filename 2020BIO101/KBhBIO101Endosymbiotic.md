# Endosymbiotic Theory
Endosymbiotic theory states that organelles within our current eukaryotic cells — the mitochondria and chloroplasts — are originally prokaryotic cells in their own right. This is because they divide independently through binary fission, and also contains circular DNA that is independent of the main cell itself.
