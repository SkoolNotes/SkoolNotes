**QUESTIONS:**

**Reflect on what you learned from this resource about the connection between science/medicine and ideas about race:**

1.  What resource did you choose and what important ideas did you explore that you would hope could be known more widely? 
I chose the []()

3.  What was most surprising or interesting to you in particular and why? 
4.  How should science and/or medicine address their role in perpetuating ideas about race and racism? (you can focus on the specific issue you explored or think more broadly here). If your resource didn't feel focused enough to answer this question, fell free to instead tell me more here about what you learned and how it connects to the genetics stuff we've been learning in class.
