# Carbohydrates
Glucose, Cellulose, Lactose, etc. etc.

## Structures of Carbs
* Carbs have **6 carbons.**
* Carbon chain with Hydrogen and Hydroxide
* Dissolves well in water because of the slightly positive hydrogen and the slightly negative OH

> So, if you see a hexagon carbon ring, you are probably looking at a carbohydrate

You could take many "simple sugars" (glucose, for instance) and chain them to build wonderfully complicated things (fiber!). To see how that happens:  [[KBhBIO101StructuresofCarbs]]

## Uses of Carbs
* Mitocondria
    * Actually not strictly part of a cell!
    * Another organism (technically an organelle)
        * Could move
        * Could replicate
    * Breaks down stored carbs (glycogen) into glucose and then eventually smaller elements
* Cell tagging
    * As an authentication systems
    * 
    
## The Carbs Debate
* Fructose worse? Better? No difference?
* Experiments differ
    * Generally found no differences
    * Some found fructose to be a bit more obesity causing
