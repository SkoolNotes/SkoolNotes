# Retroviruses
**Viruses that have the ability to intergrate into the chromosomes of the host cell**

## Retroviruses, infection
Normal [[KBhBIO101ViralInfection]] infection stuff happen, but then...

* As the virus is uncoated, it uses an enzyme called "reverse transcriptaese" to turn ssRNA to cDNA, and finally into dsDNA (template strand DNA).
* And, ready for this? The virus then uses an enzyme called **intergraese** to thread the viral dsDNA into the cell's normal nucleaus

A bonus for HIV (which is a Retrovirus) â€” it utilities **protease** to cut HIV's polyproteins into individual parts ready for budding.

## Retroviruses, Late Stage
The proviral region (the part that makes virus) newly inserted to the cell's DNA is transcribed slowly when ribosomes comes across it
