# DNA Extraction
#flo 

* DNA Extraction
* Two main steps
	* Breaking the cells open chemically, by breaking the membrane of the cell. Some substance/method also has to break open the nucleus after the previous one is done.
		=> (Of course, you could also acoustically, by ultrasonic waves to break, or mechanically, by like breaking breaking it)
	* Then, DNA is seperated from other proteins & debries
		=> This is usually done with either enzymes or using heat
