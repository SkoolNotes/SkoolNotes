# DNA Extraction
#flo 

* DNA Extraction
* Two main steps
	* Breaking the cells open chemically, by breaking the membrane of the cell. Some substance/method also has to break open the nucleus after the previous one is done.
		=> (Of course, you could also acoustically, by ultrasonic waves to break, or mechanically, by like breaking breaking it)
		* The chemical usually used to do this is a **detergent**, like soap
		* Lipid bi-layer gets attracted to the hydrophobic tails, then 
		* Or, changing the pH of the solution may also be one method by which this could take place
	* Then, DNA is separated from other proteins & debris
		=> This is usually done with either enzymes or using heat
