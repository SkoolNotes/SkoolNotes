# Evolution
*The unifying theory of all biology involving any change in the heritable traits in a population over a long period of time.*

**Causes of of evolution**
- different reproduction rates
- Environmental pressures
- non-random mate choices
- Migration


**Evidence for evolution**
- Lab evidence of short-lifespan bacteria
- Fossels and and DNA evidence

***

## Begin by defining evolution
=> Descend with modification

**Micro-evolution**: changes in alleal frequency within a population from one generation to the next

**Macro-evolution**: descend of different special from a common ancestry over much longer timescales

_Remember: evolution happens over **deep time** — much longer than your monkey brain could feasibly preserved_

The size of civilization to now is about 10,000 years, which is 0.002 seconds if all history is 1 minute.

### DNA Evidence for evolution
Comparing DNA between spcecis could show an idea of common ancestry.

**Evolution Experiment**

- Take bacteria
- Introduce a filter/challenge (antibiotic) 
- Result: resistant bacterial is left, and they prosper

### Fossil Example
- Analyzing fossils over time 

## Origin of Life
(Before there was evolution)

- RNA world Hypothesis => RNA started self replicating and kabamm
- Metabolism Evolution 

The Miller-Agieri experiment: fundamental earth molecule + heats and pressure => kabamm amino acids and DNA and other organic molecules.

## Common Ancestry
All life on earth is related by descent from a universal ancestor.

There is a certain ancestor LUCA — which is the Last Universal Common Ancestor.

## Mechanisms of evolution
- Natural Selection
- Genetic drift
- Gene flow
- Variations/Mutations

### Natural Selection
- Variatinon => for a certain trait, there are differences between individuals 
- Heritability => differences that could be passed through generations
- Reproductive advantage => ability to increase rate of reproduction/competition

*Natural selection could change allele frequencies in a particular population over time.*

After a longer time, eventually, natural selection will make new species.

**Sexual selection: a special case**
*The process of natural selection acting on an organism's ability to access mates/fertilization.*

_Direct Benefits_
-  Care, food, territory, etc.

_Indirect Benefits_
- Choosing of the most competent male
- "Good genes" of ornamentation (looking pretty is costly)

This could also produce harmful results (looking good also attracts predators.)

### Genetic Drift + Gene Flow
*Mechanisms of evolution without adaptation*

**Genetic Drift**

- Traits are not selected because they are beneficial against environmental pressures
- Allele frequencies change based on random chance or events

Random bottlenecks (like, colonization) cause the next generation to randomly have a large alleal that's not at all competitive.

**Gene Flow**
Movement/migration of one individual with a dominante gene over takes the others/change genetic makeup.

### Mutations

## Speciation
When does many many mutations build up into one new species?

1. Establishing a barrier to gene flow
2. Genetic divergence accumulation until reproductive seperation

Variation => Natural Selection => Evolution => Speciation
