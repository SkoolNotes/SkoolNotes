# Evolution
*The unifying theory of all biology involving any change in the heritable traits in a population over a long period of time.*

**Causes of of evolution**
- different reproduction rates
- Environmental pressures
- non-random mate choices
- Migration

**Evidence for evolution**
- Lab evidence of short-lifespan bacteria
- Fossels and and DNA evidence

## Begin by defining evolution
=> Descend with modification

**Micro-evolution**: changes in alleal frequency within a population from one generation to the next

**Macro-evolution**: descend of different special from a common ancestry over much longer timescales

_Remember: evolution happens over **deep time** â€” much longer than your monkey brain could feasibly preserved_

The size of civilization to now is about 10,000 years, which is 0.002 seconds if all history is 1 minute.

### DNA Evidence for evolution
Comparing DNA between spcecis could show an idea of common ancestry.

**Evolution Experiment**

- Take bacteria
- Introduce a filter/challenge (antibiotic) 
- Result: resistant bacterial is left, and they prosper

### Fossil Example
- Analyzing fossils over time 

## Origin of Life
(Before there was evolution)

- **RNA world Hypothesis**
- **Metabolism Evolution**
