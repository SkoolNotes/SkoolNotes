      <p><strong>Atoms</strong> Are the fundamental building blocks of the universe. Atoms make up matter, and they are made of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The number of protons within a given atom determines what element it is. The neutrons bind said protons together. Electrons reside on rings (orbits) around the nucleus of the atom, and are attracted to this nucleus. The count and placement of these electrons, in part, determine the <strong>electronegativity</strong> of an atom. Electronegativity is a measure of an atoms attraction to shared electron pairs. It is fundamental in forming <strong>chemical bonds</strong>. Bond types are dependent upon the difference in electronegativity of the atoms bonding. A difference between 0.4 1.7 (if I remember correctly) forms a polar covalent bond. Below 0.4 is non-polar, and above 1.7 is ionic. These differences in electronegativity also effect the <strong>polarity</strong> of the molecule they form. Polarity is a very important concept, and effects how molecules interact with one another. For example, this allows water to form hydrogen bonds, and quite a bit more. Polarity determines whether a substance is hydrophobic or hydrophilic, which determines the way <strong>proteins</strong> <strong>fold</strong>. The way proteins fold determines the function of the protein – one such function is converting <strong>carbohydrates</strong> to ATP. ATP (along with <strong>Lipids</strong> which is commonly used to hold energy in the form of fat) is the primary <strong>energy</strong> carrying molecule of virtually all carbon based life forms. Energy is required for chemical reactions to occur. As things always seek their lowest energy form, reactants can get stuck in a “valley,” where the energy required to initiate a reaction (the activation energy) is higher than their current state. In order to surpass this barrier, energy must be added to the reaction. One way of lowering this activation energy is with <strong>enzymes</strong>. Enzymes are a type of bio-catalyst which, as previously noted, helps facilitate reactions by lowering their activation energy. This increases reaction rate, just like heat does. every single one of these reactions contributes to the inevitable heat death of the universe due to <strong>The Second Law of Thermodynamics</strong>, which states that the entropy in an isolated system cannot decrease, and instead only increases. Entropy is the …. my ten minute timer just went off.</p>
