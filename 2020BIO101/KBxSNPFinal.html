            <p>The <em>COMT</em> gene, or catechol-O-methyltransferase, encodes the <em>COMT</em> enzyme which is responsible for breaking down neurotransmitters the brain’s prefrontal cortex. More specifically, it acts as a catalyst for the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. This process, called O-methylation, leads to the degradation of the aforementioned neurotransmitters. The <em>COMT</em> enzyme also effects the metabolism of exogenous substances, but that is irrelevant for the mutation at hand <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1312">citation</a>. The <em>COMT</em> gene itself is 27.22kb long and located on chromosome 22q11.2 <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1572656/">citation</a>. It has ubiquitous expression in 27 tissues, including the placenta, the adrenal, and the lung <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1312#gene-expression">citation</a>. Val158Met, also known as rs4680, is a common missense mutation swapping a guanine for an adenine. It has the frequency G=0.510915, and thus, A=0.489085. Val158Met causes the <em>COMT</em> enzyme to be roughly 25% as effective compared to the wild type. Expression levels in mRNA, despite its reduced protein abundance, are not effected by Val158Met <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/dm/2020/8850859/">citation</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(07)63786-0">citation</a>. Thus, Val158Met must be located in a protein-coding region causing the <em>COMT</em> enzyme to have lower protein integrity, explaining the discrepancy between mRNA expression and protein expression. This lower protein integrity is most likely manifested as diminished thermostability of the enzyme <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7703232/">citation</a>. The higher level effect of this reduced enzyme efficacy is greatly debated, and linked to many different phenotypes. At a broad level, lower <em>COMT</em> activity leads to higher levels of catecholamines in the prefrontal cortex. The actual effect of these increased levels are not well understood. One proposed theory is the Warrior versus Worrier hypothesis, which outlines two groups of personality traits based upon the Val158Met mutation <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17008817/">citation</a>. The “Warrior” group, defined as the wild type group with lower levels of catecholamines like dopamine, are said to have an advantage in processing aversive stimuli. They are also said to have higher pain tolerance, be less prone to stress, less exploratory, and ect. However, many of these claims are not well defined and bordering on pseudoscience <a href="https://selfdecode.com/snp/rs4680/">citation</a>. The “Worrier” group, those with the mutation, are said to have an advantage in memory and attention tasks <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17008817/">citation</a>. The Val158Met mutation has also been linked to schizophrenia, but this claim is debated <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32931693/">citation</a>.</p>

            <pre><code>This is looking good so far. It is based in solid research and you&#39;re clear about what&#39;s still unknown or uncertain. I&#39;m noticing that you don&#39;t discuss any known regulators of COMT expression (transcription factors, environmental signals, etc). Try to work that in. If there are none reported, you can mention that in the write-up. I also think you can add a bit more clarity in the portion where you&#39;re discussing the integrity/stability of the mutant protein. You&#39;ve said it leads to lower abundance. Is the decreased enzyme activity related direction to enzyme function or based on lower total abundance?</code></pre>

It has ubiquitous expression in 27 tissues, including the placenta, the adrenal, and the lung <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1312#gene-expression">citation</a>. This expression is dynamically regulated during brain development and due to environmental stimuli. Despite much research into COMT regulation, the actual processes are still mostly unknown <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21095457/">citation</a>. COMT has two promoters — P2 functions constitutively, whereas P1 has tissue dependent regulation <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8672242/">citation</a>.
