# Notes

### Genomes
 - The Nucleus contains genes organized into two parts
	 - Each part is called a genome
		 - One is sourced from you mother and one from your father
	 - Genomes are not the same
 - Breaking up the genome into pieces those are called chromosomes
	 - Humans have 23
	 - Having two genomes makes us 2N
 - Each chromosome has a bunch of genes that are divided up into three parts: the promoter	(beginning), coding region (middle), and the terminator (end)
	 - Each gene has enough information for a protein
	 - Each genome has enough information to generate a human
