# Notes

### Genomes

 - The Nucleus contains genes organized into two parts
	 - Each part is called a genome
		 - One is sourced from you mother and one from your father
	 - Genomes are not the same
 - Breaking up the genome into pieces those are called chromosomes
	 - Humans have 23
	 - Having two genomes makes us 2N
 - Each chromosome has a bunch of genes that are divided up into three parts: the promoter	(beginning), coding region (middle), and the terminator (end)
	 - Each gene has enough information for a protein
	 - Each genome has enough information to generate a human

### Epigenetics

 - The epigenome is defined as the collection of DNA, RNA, proteins, and their chemical modifications (generally altering gene expression)
	 - Epigenetic modifications are done by adding marks to the tails of histones
		 - The addition of an acetyl group causes the tale to relax and release DNA
			 - This increases transcription
		 - Methyl groups can either increase or decrease that pattern of gene expression depending
			 -  putting this directly on DNA permanently shut it down
 -  When the envoirnment of a cell changes it creates epigenetic modifications
	 -  This is also very useful to cancers as more than half of known cancers contain mutations involved in regulation
 
 
 ### DNA Packaging
 
  - Packaging DNA starts with the assembly of a nucleosome via eight separate histone protein sub units attaching to the DNA
	  - This creates a tight loop called the nucleosome
  - Multiple nucleosomes are coiled together and stacked on top of eachother creating what is known as chromatin
	  - These are then looped and further packaged
  - These make tightly formed structures called chromosomes
  - DNA is in usually a less organized form during division
