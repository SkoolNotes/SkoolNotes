# Proteins

## Structures
 - Proteins account for 50% of the dray mass of most cells
 - Enzymes are mostly proteins
 - Very structurally complex
	 - They are constructed from the same 20 sets of amino acids
 - A polypeptide is a polymer of amino acids
	 - A protein is made up of one or more polypeptides
 - A protein must serve a biological function to be a protein
	 - It also must be folded and coiled into a specific 3 dimensional structure
 - There are many types of proteins
	 - Enzymatic proteins
	 - Defensive proteins
	 - Storage proteins
	 - Transport proteins
		 - Transport of substances
		 - 
	 - Hormonal proteins
		 - COordination of an organism's activities
		 - Insulin is an example as it causes other tissues to take up glucose thus regulating the blood sugar concentration
	 - Receptor proteins
		 - Response of cell to chemical stimuli
		 - Responsible for stuff like detecting signaling molecules released by other nerve cells
	 - Contractile and motor proteins
		 - Meant for movement
		 - Responsible for stuff like flagella
	 - Structural proteins
		 - They are used as support
		 - Keratin is an example
 
 
 ## Amino Acids
  - All amino acids share a common structure
	  - It is an organic molecule with both an amino group and a carboxyl group
		  - An amino group is two Hydrogens bonded with a nitrogen and a carboxyl group is an oxygen double bonded with a carbon and an OH bonded with the same carbon
