# Viral Attachment
Most viral attachment processes is done in two different steps:

1. Attachment: adhere roughly to random sugar proteins
2. Binding: roll over slowly, and bind to the entry receptor it needs

*Note! Both of these processes will require specific protein "spikes" that are specifically designed to stick to the host cell.* **This is what causes the organism-specific responses to viruses.**
