# Notes

 ### DNA/RNA
 
 - Nucleotides make up DNA and RNA
	 - DNA and RNA have different levels of stability
		 - This is all because of the hydroxyl group vs just the hydrogen
	 - If the second carbon does not have an oxygen then it is DNA
		 - You would write the letter d
	 - If there is a T then put a T
	 - Count the number of phosphates and use the code
		 - 1 is Mono - M
		 - 2 is Di - D
		 - 3 Tri - T
	 - Phosphate groups determine the amount of energy in the molecule

### Central Dogma of Biology

 - From the DNA an RNA is created
 - From the RNA a protein is generated
