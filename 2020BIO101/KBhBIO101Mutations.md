Pyrimides - cytosine + thymine. Single ring.

These are usually paired up with 

Purines -  adenine + guanine. Double ring.

So if a mutation replaces adenine and guanine, it would has less of an effect because a double ring is still matched with a single ring. But if an adenine is replaced by thymine, we could have a bigger isuue because double-double ring is much longer than a traditional single/double match.
