# Virus Infections and Lifecycle

## Viral Life Cycle, an Overview
1. **Attachment** => protein contact between virus and host
2. **Viral entry/Uncoating** => shedding the protein layer
3. **Biosynthesis** => make baby viruses
	1. Genome Replication: transcribe DNA/RNA
	2. Genome Expression: read DNA/RNA to make proteins
4.  **Genome integration** => retrovirus only â€” put the viral gene into the genetic sequence of the actual cell
5.  **Assembly** => put it all togethr
6.  **Viral Exit** => mature virons leave

## Viral Entry
*Option 1: Direct Injection/insertion*

- Insert genome through the bi-layer
- Leave the rest behind
- Tada!

*Option 2: Endocytosis*

- Trick the host cell into introducing the virus as food
- Endocytosis!
- Bam

*Option 3: Fusion*
 
 - Virus fuse with cell membrane
 - Shed the protein coat once in
 - Shazam!

**All of these involve attachment first, which usually takes two steps.**

This process causes the organism-specific response to viruses:

1. Attachment: adhere roughly to random sugar proteins
2. Binding: roll over slowly, and bind to the entry receptor it needs

#### Uncoating
* Virus triggers *early endosome*
	* Causes pH dependent protein denaturation
	* Causing the capsid to fall apart
	* Triggering *late endosome* => releasing genome

#### Viral Replication
Key questions:

- **How are viral mRNAs produced from the viral genome?** => virus will hijack the ribosomes in the host cells. So, it is more important to ask how the mRNAs are produced to tell ribosomes what to do
- **What serves as the template for viral genome replication** => replication will need a polymeraese; but the source and mechanism is dependent on viral genome structure/composition

**DNA Viruses**

*How are viral mRNAs produced from the viral genome?*

- Viral DNA enters, through RNA polymerase II in the host cell, mRNA is produced
- mRNAs then read  by ribosomes, and there we go

*What serves as the templates for viral genome replication?*

- Viral DNA serves as template for host cell DNA polymerase
- Viral genome copied repeatedly
- Virus, then, **will be replicated within the nucleus** due to it needing the polymerase to copy DNA

Except! Poxvirade carry their own polymerase, so they replicate in the cytoplasm.

**RNA Viruses**

*How are viral mRNAs produced from the viral genome?*

#### Packaging

Does not require ATP. Just sealed in.

#### Viral Exis

**Lysis**

Replicate so much that the membrane burst.

**Budding**

Trigger...

- Trigger extocytosis
- Meanwhile, send virus's own spikes to the membrane
- On exit by extocytosis, steal a part of the newly-spikey membrane with it to serve as new casing
