# Virus Infections and Lifecycle

## Viral Life Cycle, an Overview
1. **Attachment** => protein contact between virus and host
2. **Viral entry** => entering the cell
3. **Uncoating** => shedding the protein layer
4. **Biosynthesis** => make baby viruses
	1. Genome Replication: transcribe DNA/RNA
	2. Genome Expression: read DNA/RNA to make proteins
5.  **Genome integration** => retrovirus only â€” put the viral gene into the genetic sequence of the actual cell
6.  **Assembly** => put it all together
7.  **Viral Exit** => mature virons leave

## Viral attachment
To be able to enter a cell, viruses have to do something to stick to it. B/c otherwise they would just be stuck in the bloodstream and be very sod.

Most viral attachment processes is done in two different steps:

1. Attachment: adhere roughly to random sugar proteins
2. Binding: roll over slowly, and bind to the entry receptor it needs

*Note! Both of these processes will require specific protein "spikes" that are specifically designed to stick to the host cell.* **This is what causes the organism-specific responses to viruses.**

## Viral Entry
In this step, the sticky virus on the surface of the cell gets into the cell. There are three different types of mechanisms by which this is achieved:

### Direct Injection/insertion
- Insert genome through the bi-layer
- Leave the rest behind

### Endocytosis
- Trick the host cell into introducing the virus as food
- Endocytosis!
- Bam

### Fusion
 - Virus fuse with cell membrane
 - Shed the protein coat once in
 - Shazam!

## Uncoating
After the virus enters the cell, the lipid/protein shell on the outside must be shred to be able to release the additional DNA inside.

To achieve this, the virus triggers *early endosome* in the cell, which...

* Causes pH dependent protein denaturation
* Causing the capsid to fall apart
* Triggering *late endosome* => releasing genome

## Viral Replication
Now, with the viruses's DNA out on full display inside the cell, how do we make another virus? There are two key questions that must be asked to answer this:

- **How are viral mRNAs produced from the viral genome?** => virus will hijack the ribosomes in the host cells. So, it is more important to ask how the mRNAs are produced to tell ribosomes what to do
- **What serves as the template for viral genome replication** => replication will need a polymeraese; but the source and mechanism is dependent on viral genome structure/composition

**For DNA Viruses...**

*How are viral mRNAs produced from the viral genome?*

- Viral DNA enters, through RNA polymerase II in the host cell, mRNA is produced
- mRNAs then read  by ribosomes, and there we go

*What serves as the templates for viral genome replication?*

- Viral DNA serves as template for host cell DNA polymerase
- Viral genome copied repeatedly
- Virus, then, **will be replicated within the nucleus** due to it needing the host polymerase to copy DNA

Except! Poxvirade viruses carry their own polymerase, so they replicate in the cytoplasm by simply entering and releasing the polymerease.

**RNA Viruses**

*How are viral mRNAs produced from the viral genome?*


#### Packaging

Does not require ATP. Just sealed in.

#### Viral Exis

**Lysis**

Replicate so much that the membrane burst.

**Budding**

Trigger...

- Trigger extocytosis
- Meanwhile, send virus's own spikes to the membrane
- On exit by extocytosis, steal a part of the newly-spikey membrane with it to serve as new casing
