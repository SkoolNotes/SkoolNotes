# Amino Acids

## Basics
### Functional Groups
Components of amino acids that, well, build an amino acid:

- Alcohol Group: H-O-R (part of the Carboxyl when R=C, as in H-O-C)
- Carbonyl: C=O (part of carboxyl)
- Carboxyl/Carboxylic Acid: H-O-C=O  (left side of backbone) ![[Screen Shot 2020-10-12 at 2.29.28 PM]]
- Ether: R-O-R (structure of glycocidic bonds formed by dehydration)
- Ester: R-O-C-O (structure that joins fatty acid and glycerol together)
- Hydroxyl: OH group. Need I say more?

### The Dang Amino Acids
An Amino Acid is... **(H-O-C=O) Carboxylic acid + Single Carbon Backbone +  Amine (H3N+)**

At the carbon backbone, any arbiturary thing "R group, or Sidechain" may be connected to it {ring, chain, etc.} that is unique to the amino acid

Here's an amino acid

The White parts => "Backbone" aforementioned

The Orange parts => "sidechain"

## Proteins 

[[KBhBIO101Proteins]] are important biological structures formed by dehydrating multiple amino acids together
