# Amino Acids

## Basics
H-O-C: Alcahol Group
C=O: Carboneel
(H-O-C=O) Carboxylic acid + Single Carbon Backbone +  Amine (H3N+)

At the carbon backbone, any arbiturary thing "R group, or Sidechain" may be connected to it {ring, chain, etc.} that is unique to the amino acid

Here's an amino acid

The White parts => "Backbone" aforementioned

The Orange parts => "sidechain"


Proteins formed by dehydrating multiple amino acids together

All cell uses _rybozome_ to force animo acids together to make proteins. And yes, if you have a high energy source that would not require ATP from itself (make life from not life), you could get proteans to fold.

## Protean Shapes

Proteins, when unfolded, is a long chain of amino acids. When they are folded in different configurations, you get a working protean.

Different folds result in differenta functions

"The Protean Folding Problem" => can we find the fold of the protean just by the unfolded amino acids?

### Protean primary structure

The linear order of amino acids â€” staring from the amino terminus (N, exposes the _Amine_ end) and moving to carbonxy terminusi (C, exposes the _Carboxy_ terminus).

Average protean is about 300 amino acids long.o

### Protean secondary structure

Folding a protean without concern to the amino acid side chains. The folding is only concerned with being stabilized with dipole attraction to hydrogen.

Two main secondary structures: the alpha helix and beta sheet.

**No ionic attractions between backbone because after the dehydration reaction (polymerization), the positive and negative of the two ends of the backbone of the amino acid is combined to cancel out the charge**

Proline (p) is a little weird: Side chain bonded with the H2N+ as well as the carbon

### Protein Tertiary Structure

Bonds in the 3D Structures

* Non-polar sidechains: Vandervaull's Forces (a.k.a LDF)
* Ionic sidechains: what bonds do you think?
* Disulfide bonds: cysteine animo acids will bond their sulfur together
* Polar sidechains: hydrogen bonds

All of these bonds, together, makes the 3D geometry of the protean.
