# Amino Acids


H-O-C: Alcahol Group
C=O: Carboneel
(H-O-C=O) Carboxylic acid + Single Carbon Backbone +  Amine (H3N+)

At the carbon backbone, any arbiturary thing "R group, or Sidechain" may be connected to it {ring, chain, etc.} that is unique to the amino acid

Here's an amino acid

The White parts => "Backbone" aforementioned

The Orange parts => "sidechain"


Proteins formed by dehydrating multiple amino acids together

All cell uses _rybozome_ to force animo acids together to make proteins. And yes, if you have a high energy source that would not require ATP from itself (make life from not life), you could get proteans to fold.
