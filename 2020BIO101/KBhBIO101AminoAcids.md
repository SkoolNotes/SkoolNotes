# Amino Acids

## Basics
H-O-C: Alcahol Group
C=O: Carboneel
(H-O-C=O) Carboxylic acid + Single Carbon Backbone +  Amine (H3N+)

At the carbon backbone, any arbiturary thing "R group, or Sidechain" may be connected to it {ring, chain, etc.} that is unique to the amino acid

Here's an amino acid

The White parts => "Backbone" aforementioned

The Orange parts => "sidechain"

## Proteins 

[[KBhBIO201Proteins]] are important biological structures formed by dehydrating multiple amino acids together
