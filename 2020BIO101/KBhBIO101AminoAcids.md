# Amino Acids
## Basics
### Functional Groups
Components of amino acids that, well, build an amino acid (among other things):

See [[KBhBIO101FunctionalGroups]].

### The Dang Amino Acids
An Amino Acid is... **(H-O-C=O) Carboxylic acid + Single Carbon Backbone +  Amine (H3N+)**

At the carbon backbone, any arbiturary thing "R group, or Sidechain" may be connected to it {ring, chain, etc.} that is unique to the amino acid

Here's an amino acid

The White parts => "Backbone" aforementioned

The Orange parts => "Sidechain"

A small chain of amino acids are called "peptide". Put many of those together and you get a...

## Protein!

[[KBhBIO101Proteins]] are important biological structures formed by dehydrating multiple amino acids together.
