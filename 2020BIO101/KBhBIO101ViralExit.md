# Viral Exit
There are two ways how mature virons could exit the host cell:

## Lysis
Replicate so much that the membrane burst.

## Budding
- Trigger extocytosis
- Meanwhile, send virus's own spikes to the membrane
- On exit by extocytosis, steal a part of the newly-spikey membrane with it to serve as new casing
