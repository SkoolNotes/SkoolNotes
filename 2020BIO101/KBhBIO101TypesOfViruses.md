# Types of Viruses
## Prokarotic infecting viruses
* Variety of shapes
* Complex and prolate shapes
* Has, sometimes complex shapes! a la [this image](Screen Shot 2020-10-12 at 10.49.04 PM.png)
* Usually transmits using the DNA

## Eukarotic infecting viruses
* Much more "boring" in terms of shape
* Icosahedral/spherecial outside
* Enveloped constructions => envelope protein layer outside, spherical inside
* Helical/Cylindrical/Bullet shapes, too!
* Often single patterns assemble together to create symmetric shape that creates the whole of the virus 
* Usually transmits using the RNA

RNA viruses are considered to be the "next-gen" viruses because they infect much more easily as they do not require the process of transcription.
