# Types of Viruses
## Categorizing based on infection target
### Prokarotic infecting viruses
* Variety of shapes
* Complex and prolate shapes
* Has, sometimes complex shapes! a la [this image](Screen Shot 2020-10-12 at 10.49.04 PM.png)
* Usually transmits using the DNA

### Eukarotic infecting viruses
* Much more "boring" in terms of shape
* Icosahedral/spherecial outside
* Enveloped constructions => envelope protein layer outside, spherical inside
* Helical/Cylindrical/Bullet shapes, too!
* Often single patterns assemble together to create symmetric shape that creates the whole of the virus 
* Usually transmits using the RNA

## Categorizing based on genetic code
### DNA Viruses
* "Legacy support" viruses
* **DNA** viruses are "less complex", in that as long as they are able to get into the nucleaus, the rest would just be the body's work automatically.
* They are clunkier, more stable, and hence harder to [[KBhBIO101ViralGeneticModulationMutation]], which is good for you but bad for the virus

### RNA Viruses
* RNA viruses are considered to be the "next-gen" viruses
* They infect much more easily => do not require the process of transcription
* Contain more intricate processes to be able to interact with the cell properly
