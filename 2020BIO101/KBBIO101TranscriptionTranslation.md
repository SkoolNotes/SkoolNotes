## Transcription
 - Polymerase
	 - The thing that copies it over
 - Promoter
	 - The structure that chooses which genes to copy
 - Coding Region
	- The area of DNA to be copied
- mRNA
	- What the polymerase outputs (DNA copy inverse)
- Terminator
	- The tail end of the coding region that folds making the RNA fall off
- This creates the mRNA and the siRNA and tRNA


## Outside signals
 - Signals to outside receptors create positive or negative transcription factors
	 - These can be activated by internal signals
	 - positive transcription factors allow for and encourage transcription
	 - negative transcription factors cause the release of a molecule that take the slot of polymerase shutting down the gene and not allowing for transcription

## Mutations
 - There are different types of mutations such as a substitution mutation
