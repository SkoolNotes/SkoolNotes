# Polymers
- Each unit is a sugar
- A polymer with n units has more energy than n monomers
- On average: **The more units there are, the more energy it contains**
	- Bonds between units store energy
		- Right when the bonds are broken, energy is released
			- Requires energy to break bonds, though
	- Creation of bonds stores energy
		- How lipids work???
