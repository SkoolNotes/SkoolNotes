# DNA Transcription
The process of DNA transcription is done by the RNA Polymerase Enzyme. DNA transcription begins by ripping apart hydrogen bonds using DNAse enzyme, then the RNA polymerease reads one side (the "template strand", a.k.a. noncoding "antisene" strand that runs from 3' to 5') of the double helix, recognizing each nucleotide

## Starting Transcription

## Transcribing

## Finishing Transcription

* Pluck the correct corresponding nucleotide out of the nucleus
	* G->C
	* C->G
	* A->**U**
	* T->A
* Prokaryotes lack membrane-bound nucleus (or any organelle)

\definition{Gene}{information that successfully encodes a functional protein or a functional catalytic RNA}

RNAs could also be catalysts!

* "Promoter"s denotes beginning of a gene. "Terminator"s denotes the end of gene.



**Terminators**

* Found in the end of the template sequence
* Two types in prokaryotes
	*  Rho-independent terminators — roll back onto itself, causing the RNA to terminate and mRNA to be release
	*  Rho-dependent terminators — activate cofactor named rho + unwind the transcribed RNA-DNA hybrid
* In Eukarotes
	* Pol I genes — transcription stopped through termination factor by unwindng the transcribed RNA-DNA hybrid
	* Pol II genes — don't stop until the end, but a polymerase has a "cleavage" mechanism that clips the end out using a poly(A) tail consensus sequence

### Before we continue, two words
- *Non-coding sequence*: metadata for DNA for the processors
- *Coding sequence*: DNA content for amino-acid production
