### Carbohydrates
* Set 1, carbs. See Luke De's video + [[KBhBIO101Carbs]]
	* *Glucose vs. fructose* — both monosacharrides, one is a 6-carbon ring and one is a 5-carbon ring
	* *Mono vs. di. vs. polysaccharide* — carbohydrates made out of a single, double, and multiple monomer (single-unit) carbohydrates
	* *Starch vs. glycogen vs. cellulose* — lots of alpha glucose in less branches, lots of alpha glucose in more branches, lots of beta glucose in organized lattice respectively.
		* Starch — plant food reserve
		* Glycogen — animal energy reserve
		* Cellulose — cell wall in plants
* Set 2, lipids. See Luke De's video + [[KBhBIO101Lipids]]
	* *Triglyceride vs. fatty acid vs. phosophilid* see [[KBhBIO101StructuresofCarbs]]
		* Glycerol => a fatty acid
		* Triglyceride => three of 'em above
		* Phospholipid => two fatty acid + phosphate head
	* *Saturated vs unsaturated fatty acids* see also [[KBhBIO101StructuresofCarbs]] 
		* Saturated Fats => no double bonds in the carbon chain of fatty acids — think! butter
		* Unsaturated Fats => double bonds in the carbon chain of fatty acids — think! olive oil
* Identify functional groups
	* Amino acid groups — see [[KBhBIO101AminoAcids]]
		*  carboxyl — O=C-R-OH
		*  carboxylic acid — H-O-C=O  (left side of backbone)
		*  carbonyl  — C=O — part of carboxyl 
		*  amide — RC(=O)NR′R″ (frequently shown in side chains of amino acids — see [Amine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amide#/media/File:Amide-general.png))
		*  amino/amine — H3N+ (right side of backbone)
		*  hydroxyl — OH group. Need I say more?
		*  ester — take a carboxylic acid and replace the hydrogen with a R-O group  #ASK
		*  ether — R-O-R structure. Commonly shown as as an alcohol group (H-O-C) as part of the carboxyl
* Monomers vs Polymers [[KBhBIO101StructuresofCarbs]]
	* Monomer — single molecule (such as a monosacchride) that could be chained together to make polymers
	* Polymers — complex molecues built from monomers
	* Building polymers — dehydration reaction — taking out water molecules
	* Destructing polymers — hydration reaction — adding in water molecules
	
### Cell Structures
* Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic
	* Prokaryotic cells — often in single-cellular cells, has a cell wall, and contained in capsules
	* Eukaryotic cells — in multicellular cell elements, contains a plasma membranes and nucleus
* Compare and contrast a typical animal cell with a typical plant cell. Be able to label diagrams of each.
	* Animal Cell
		* No cell wall
		* No chloroplast
		* Has Cytoplasm
		* Has Ribosomes
		* Has Mitochondria
		* No plastids — organelle pigments
		* Hair-like items on the outer surface
