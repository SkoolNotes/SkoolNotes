And Jack's raw answers: [[KBhBIO201BioMoleculesRAW]]

"""
- **Enzymes lower the activation energy by some combination ofâ€¦**
	- Orienting the reactions substrate(s) to promote more effective collisions (and therefore reactions
	- Stressing or straining bonds to temporarily and/or slightly lower the strength of attraction to allow the bond to break more easily
	- Involving amino acid R-groups or sidechains in creating the transition state between reactants and products
	
Enzymes have active sites that bring substrates together and may change shape to stabilize the transition state; known as Induced Fit upon binding active site and slight change in enzyme shape.

Most enzymes are proteins, and thus their activity can be directly influenced by modifications or environmental factors, such as temperature and pH, that alter their three-dimensional structure.

 Enzyme activity may be regulated/inhibited by molecules that compete with substrates to occupy the active site (competitive inhibitor) or alter enzyme shape so that substrates become unable to enter the active site (non-competitive inhibitor).
