### Carbohydrates
**Use appearance size, and presence of functional groups to distinguish between the major classes of biomolecules we discussed (carbohydrate, lipid, proteins) and the subclasses within each**

* Set 1, carbs. See Luke De's video + [[KBhBIO101Carbs]]
	* *Glucose vs. fructose* — both monosacharrides, one is a 6-carbon ring and one is a 5-carbon ring
	* *Mono vs. di. vs. polysaccharide* — carbohydrates made out of a single, double, and multiple monomer (single-unit) carbohydrates
	* *Starch vs. glycogen vs. cellulose* — lots of alpha glucose in less branches, lots of alpha glucose in more branches, lots of beta glucose in organized lattice respectively.
		* Starch — plant food reserve
		* Glycogen — animal energy reserve
		* Cellulose — cell wall in plants
* Set 2, lipids. See Luke De's video + [[KBhBIO101Lipids]]
	* *Triglyceride vs. fatty acid vs. phosophilid* see [[KBhBIO101StructuresofCarbs]]
		* Glycerol => a fatty acid
		* Triglyceride => three of 'em above
		* Phospholipid => two fatty acid + phosphate head
	* *Saturated vs unsaturated fatty acids* see also [[KBhBIO101StructuresofCarbs]] 
		* Saturated Fats => no double bonds in the carbon chain of fatty acids — think! butter
		* Unsaturated Fats => double bonds in the carbon chain of fatty acids — think! olive oil
* Identify functional groups
	*  carboxyl/carboxylic acid
	*  carbonyl
	*  amide
	*  amino/amine
	*  ester
	*  ether
	*  hydroxyl
