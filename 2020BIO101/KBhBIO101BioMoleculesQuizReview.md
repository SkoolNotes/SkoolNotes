### Carbohydrates
* Set 1, carbs. See Luke De's video + [[KBhBIO101Carbs]]
	* *Glucose vs. fructose* — both monosacharrides, one is a 6-carbon ring and one is a 5-carbon ring
	* *Mono vs. di. vs. polysaccharide* — carbohydrates made out of a single, double, and multiple monomer (single-unit) carbohydrates
	* *Starch vs. glycogen vs. cellulose* — lots of alpha glucose in less branches, lots of alpha glucose in more branches, lots of beta glucose in organized lattice respectively.
		* Starch — plant food reserve
		* Glycogen — animal energy reserve
		* Cellulose — cell wall in plants
* Set 2, lipids. See Luke De's video + [[KBhBIO101Lipids]]
	* *Triglyceride vs. fatty acid vs. phosophilid* see [[KBhBIO101StructuresofCarbs]]
		* Glycerol => a fatty acid
		* Triglyceride => three of 'em above
		* Phospholipid => two fatty acid + phosphate head
	* *Saturated vs unsaturated fatty acids* see also [[KBhBIO101StructuresofCarbs]] 
		* Saturated Fats => no double bonds in the carbon chain of fatty acids — think! butter
		* Unsaturated Fats => double bonds in the carbon chain of fatty acids — think! olive oil
* Identify functional groups
	* Amino acid groups — see [[KBhBIO101AminoAcids]]
		*  carboxyl — O=C-R-OH
		*  carboxylic acid — H-O-C=O  (left side of backbone)
		*  carbonyl  — C=O — part of carboxyl 
		*  amide — RC(=O)NR′R″ (frequently shown in side chains of amino acids — see [Amine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amide#/media/File:Amide-general.png))
		*  amino/amine — H3N+ (right side of backbone)
		*  hydroxyl — OH group. Need I say more?
		*  ester — take a carboxylic acid and replace the hydrogen with a R-O group  #ASK
		*  ether — R-O-R structure. Commonly shown as as an alcohol group (H-O-C) as part of the carboxyl
* Monomers vs Polymers [[KBhBIO101StructuresofCarbs]]
	* Monomer — single molecule (such as a monosacchride) that could be chained together to make polymers
	* Polymers — complex molecues built from monomers
	* Building polymers — dehydration reaction — taking out water molecules
	* Destructing polymers — hydration reaction — adding in water molecules
	
### Cell Structures
* Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic
	* Prokaryotic cells — often in single-cellular cells, has a cell wall, and contained in capsules
	* Eukaryotic cells — in multicellular cell elements, contains a plasma membranes and nucleus
* Compare and contrast a typical animal cell with a typical plant cell. Be able to label diagrams of each. (See... problem set 1)
	* Animal Cell
		* No cell wall
		* No chloroplast
		* Has Cytoplasm
		* Has Ribosomes
		* Has Mitochondria
		* No plastids — organelle pigments
		* Has Cilla — Hair-like items on the outer surface 
	* Plant Cell
		* Has cell wall
		* Has chloroplast — photosynthesis
		* Has cytoplasm
		* Has Ribosomes
		* Has Mitochondria
		* Has plastics — organelle pigments
		* Mostly has no Cilla
* Endosymbiotic theory 
	* 	Endosymbiotic theory states that organelles within our current eukaryotic cells — the mitochondria and chloroplasts — are originally prokaryotic cells in their own right. This is because they divide independently through binary fission, and also contains circular DNA that is independent of the main cell itself.
* Organizing organelles based on membranes #ASK
	*  Membranous organelles — possess own plasma => regulates own macromolecure consumption, hormones, etc. Perhaps original prokarotic cells
		*  Endoplasmic reticulum => forms the network of transferring proteins and other elements
		*  Golgi body/Gioli apparatus => packs, sorts, and modifies proteins and other elements throughout the cell
	*  Non-membranous organelles — does not posess own plasma => mostly part of the cytoskeleton of a cell
		* Ribosomes => protein synthesizer in the cell
		* Centrosome => forms flangella, cilla, and handles cells divisions
		* Lysomoes => digesting large nutrients and changing them to what cells could process and work on energy metabolism
		* Mitochrondria => store ATP and extract energy from ATP
		* Vacuoles => storing water, nutrients, waste
		* Plastids => creates colours displayed in the chromoplasts
* Cell Components
	* chloroplast and mitochondria
		* Chloroplast — found in plants + does photosynthesis
		* Mitochondria — found in animals + store ATP and extract energy from ATP
	* cell wall and plasma membrane
		* Cell Wall — found in plants => surround the cell: hard
		* Plasma membrane — found in animals => surround the cell: soft [[KBhBIO101Lipids]]
	* rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and smooth ER	
		* Rough ER — covered by ribosomes and folds [[KBhBIO101Proteins]]
		* Smooth ER — not covered by ribosomes and makes [[KBhBIO101Lipids]]
	* cytosol, cytoplasm and cytoskeleton
		* 
	* nucleus and nucleolus
	* lysosomes and food vacuoles
	* cytoskeleton and microtubules
	* flagella and cilia
