# Carbohydrates
Glucose, Cellulose, Lactose, etc. etc.

## Structures
* Carbs have **6 carbons.**
* Carbon chain with Hydrogen and Hydroxide
* Dissolves well in water because of the slightly positive hydrogen and the slightly negative OH

> Basically, if you see a hexagon carbon ring, you are probably looking at a carbohydrate

Rough rule: **The more Carbons, the more energy**

## Types of Carbs('s external structures)
### Starch
* 6 Carb Spiral that folds onto it self
* Take Glucode and daisy-chain them 
* Plants use it!

### Fiber
* 6 Carb chain
* Takes cellulose

### Glycogen
* Straight chain of cellulose
* Used to store energy by humans
    * Bonded nature cause it not be detected as glucose + efficient
    * When bonds are cut, they become glucose

## Uses of Carbs
* Mitocondria
    * Actually not strictly part of a cell!
    * Another organism (technically an organelle)
        * Could move
        * Could replicate
    * Breaks down stored carbs (glycogen) into glucose and then eventually smaller elements
* Cell tagging
    * As an authentication systems
    * 
    
## The Carbs Debate
* Fructose worse? Better? No difference?
* Experiments differ
    * Generally found no differences
    * Some found fructose to be a bit more obesity causing
