# Alright, let's talk about water.

## Intra-Molecular water bonds

* As we know (or looked up from the PTable)
* Hydrogen has electronegativity of 2.20, and oxygen has EN 3.44
* The difference >0.4 <1.7 makes these bonds **polar covalent**

## Inter-Molecular water bonds properties

The hydrogens form "hydrogen tetrohedron" structure, making the following properties:

* "Sticky"
    * Cohesion — individual molecules held up well
    * Strong surface tension
    * Adhesion — other molecules stick to water pretty well
    * Water is WET!!!
        * Strong tetrahedral H-Bonds
* These bonds make water have a **high specific heat capacity.**
    * Strong bonds
    * Resistant to change
    
## Universal Solvent Properties

Water has high solubility

* Many things could dissolve in water
* Makes chemical processes quite easily
* Quite versatile — could dissolve stuff easily

# So, why is water the chosen liquid?
* Liquid at Earth temperatures
* Sticky => strong bonds that help water hold together + resist change in temperature (hence why AlcaholLand cannot exist)
* Is universal solvent
