# Form and Function in Biodiversity
@alb's favourite thing: Axolotl

## Levels of cell organization
- Cells
- Tissues
- Organ
- Organ system
- Organism

### Single Cell Sequencing
1. Isolate single cells
2. Capture RNA for each cell
3. Loud box?
4. Cluster the outputs using a clustering mechanism

(Remember that this is not a PCR reaction, b/c we are transcribing the all of the mRNA and not a segment.)
