# Cells
## The Two Major Cell Types
* **Prokaryotic cells** — often in single-cellular cells, has a cell wall, and contained in capsules
* **Eukaryotic cells** — in multicellular cell elements, contains a plasma membranes and nucleus

## Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic Cells
| Prokaryotic Cells | Both | Eukaryotic Cells |
|---|---|---|
| Cell wall | DNA | Plasma membrane |
| Capsule container | Cytoplasm | Nucleus |
| | Ribosomes | Mitochondria |
| | Membranes | |

## Eukaryotic Cells, a deep dive
### Plant and Animal Cells, Compare and Contrast
| Animal Cells | Plant Cells |
|---|---|
| No cell wall | Has cell wall |
| No chloroplast | Has chloroplast to do photosynthesis |
| Has cytoplasm | Has cytoplasm |
| Has Ribosomes | Has Ribsonmes |
| Has mitochondria | Has mitochondria |
| No plastics | Has plastids — organelles that form pigments |
| Has cilla — hair like extrusions | Mostly no cilla |

### Endosymbiotic theory
Endosymbiotic theory states that organelles within our current eukaryotic cells — the mitochondria and chloroplasts — are originally prokaryotic cells in their own right. This is because they divide independently through binary fission, and also contains circular DNA that is independent of the main cell itself.
