Free associate: atoms, 2nd law of thermodynamics, energy, electronegativity, polarity, types of chemical bonds, lipid(s), carbohydrate(s), protein(s), amino acid(s), fold, enzyme.  


Never done a free associate before, so lets see how this goes. 


- Atoms
	- Exhibit eletronegativty, which allows them to 
	- Form molecules, which exhibits the property of polarity 
	- Depending upon polarity, different types of bonds can be formed. 
	- Covalent bonds are the bonds which peptides exhibit, the bond which joins amino acids, which form proteins when chained together.
	- These proteins then fold, and the way they fold is critical to their function.
	- Some of these functions are turning carbohydrates into ATP. 
	- ATP is biological energy (along with some lipids which form fats), which is fundamental for reactions to occur. 
	- A way of lowering the activation energy for reactions to take place is with enzymes.
	- This increases reaction rate, just like heat does. 
	- Each of these reactions contributes to the inevitable heat death of the universe, due to the second law of thermodynamics 
	-
