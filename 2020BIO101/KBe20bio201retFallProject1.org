** Notes

*** Target Processes

**** Enzyme catalysis

**** Protein-ligand binding

**** signal transduction

**** allosteric regulation

*** Folding Simulation Methods

**** all-atom molecular dynamics (MD)

     - Obtains all desired information regarding the kinetics and thermodynamics

***** Time scale bottleneck

     - very slow (supercomputers -> microseconds of simulation)
     - require microsecond to milisecond time scales

****** optimizations

******* conformational sampling?
        - retains atomistic representation of the system

******* overcome kinetic trapping and thourough sampling of conformational space techniques
        - umbrella sampling
        - multicanonical algorithms
        - simulated tempering
        - transition path sampling
        - targeted molecular dynamics
        - replica exchange method molecular dynamics (REMD)
        - accelerated molecular dynamics (AMD)
          - see below
