** Notes

*** Target Processes

**** Enzyme catalysis

     catalyzing reactions with actions

**** Protein-ligand binding

     neurotransmitters (dopamine), protien is dopamine receptor
     how does the ligand bind the proper site to open the channel?
     - ligand: how to pronounce?

**** signal transduction

     bind to other protein to trigger chain of actions
     - release calcium from intercellular stores

**** allosteric regulation

     - a reason why knowing the structure and pockets is important
     - predict allosteric cites
       - similar to non-competative inhibiton?
       - but for dna binding protiens, like the dna transcription inhibitor
     - ligand binds allosteric site and activates the protien

*** Folding Simulation Methods

**** all-atom molecular dynamics (MD)
     - Obtains all desired information regarding the kinetics and thermodynamics

***** Time scale bottleneck

     - very slow (supercomputers -> microseconds of simulation)
     - require microsecond to milisecond time scales

****** optimizations

******* conformational sampling?
        - retains atomistic representation of the system

******* overcome kinetic trapping and thourough sampling of conformational space techniques
        - umbrella sampling
        - multicanonical algorithms
        - simulated tempering
        - transition path sampling
        - targeted molecular dynamics
        - replica exchange method molecular dynamics (REMD)
        - accelerated molecular dynamics (AMD)
          - see below

**** Accelerated molecular dynamics (AMD)

epic

*** Voltage gated ion channels

**** overview

***** lives on cell membrane

***** role
****** allows ions in/out
****** crucial in "excitable" cells, like neurons
****** propogates elecrical signals directionally
****** ion specific
******* Na^+
******* K^+
******* Ca^{2+}
******* Cl^-
****** triggered by voltage across cell membrane
***** parts
****** voltage sensor
****** pore/conducting pathway
****** gate
***** sodium/calcium channels
****** parts
******* one polypeptide with "four homologous domains"

** Meetings

*** 12 oct 2020
    - computational prediction modeling
      - trying to predict the crystal structure
        - why?
          - to analyze would this fit?
          - does it work with this target
    - solving the structure
      - xray cristolography
        - gold standard
        - now got the structure
          - what does that mean?
          - can we simulate how it interacts?
          - can you then do modeling on that to see if drug molecules work? are useful
    - look at some concrete examples?
    - tell a biological story alongside with computational relevance piece

**** protien synthase
     not as much simulation stuff

**** neurotransmitters
     dopamine
     sodium rushes in, electrochemical and concentration gradient
     recharge gradient by releasing potassium

***** nerst equation
      electrochemical gradient as battery

***** goldman-katz equation
      - applied to neuro
      - takes into account the concentrations of the 4 ions
        - how does the power of the battery work given those components?
        - ligands and pH can change/denature protiens, but there are also voltage gated channels

**** Voltage Driven Things
     - Heartbeart
     - nervous system
       - how do voltage gated ion channels work?

***** things to know about
       - action potential
       - voltage gated calcium channels open at depolarization threshold

****** neurotransmitters
       - "calcium mediated exocitosis of neurotransmitter vesicles in the synaptic terminal"
       - calcium rushes somewhere to allow the neurotransmitters to leave the cell

**** Case study
     - why do we care? why is this useful
     - knowing the structure can lead to some useful information
     - how did it lead to some sort of accelerated understanding?

**** prions
     - how to pronounce?

***** CJD
      - is it inheritable?
      - one case per million population

****** Casues
      - the gene that causes CJD in 5-10% of cases is PRNP
      - 87% of cases are sporatic

***** isoform
      - a different set of intons and exons
      - splicosome takes pre-RNA and cuts out intons
        - even if the pre-RNA had 10 exons, the splicosome might take a subset of those exons and remove the others
      - An isoform is a variant of that subset, an abnormal isoform is one that is "bad" and causes problems
