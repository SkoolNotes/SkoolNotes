# Viral Uncoating
This is the process by which the virus, haven [[KBhBIO101ViralEntry]]ed the cell, unwraps its lipid capsid coating and releases the DNA.

To achieve this, the virus triggers *early endosome* in the cell, which...

* Causes pH dependent protein denaturation
* Causing the capsid to fall apart
* Triggering *late endosome* => releasing genome
