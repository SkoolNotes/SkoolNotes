# DNA Replication

DNA replication is known to be "semi-conservative" — meaning that it is a process that pairs a synthesized half of the DNA with an original half of the DNA (i.e. takes the ORIGINAL template strand + makes the NEW coding strand & takes the ORIGINAL coding strand + makes the NEW template strand.)

Because **polymerases copy uni-directionally** => DNA polyemrease move along the 3' to 5' DNA to create a copy 5' to 3'. Meaning, the polymerize is able to add nucleotide onto the 3' end of the DNA.


## The Process of DNA Replication
### DNA Unzipping
=> DNA is unzipped at the origin of replication 
The parent DNA strand serves as a template for the new strand; when it is unzipped, the nucleotides are exposed for complementary base pairing. **Helicase** is the enzyme that unzips the DNA molecule, breaking the hydrogen bonds between nucleotides to expose them for complementary base pairing 


### DNA priming
First, the unwinded DNA is primed. 



* Open the DNA at an arbuiturary point using the Helicase
	* Uses two helicase => one open rightward, and one leftward. The movement of the helicase opening the DNA is called the "fork movement"
	* DNA polymerase could only add nucleotides 5' to 3'
	* As helicase open a little bit of the DNA, polymerases rushes to copy the area that opened
		* In the **leading** strand (3' to 5'), polymerase will run alongside the helicase for they are opening and replicating on the same direction
		* In the **lagging** strand (5' to 3'), polymerase will wait until the helicate opens a little segment, and rushes forward and move backwards
			* NOTE: the lagging strand... 1) takes longer to transcribe 2) is done in small chunks (each "rush forward"). Each chunk is called an ogazaki fragment

* DNA polymersease will REQUIRE a double-stranded area to begin work from, so Primase synthesize already double-stranded RNA primers that DNA polymerease could bootstrap to the single-stranded DNA to begin the replication process (think: create-react-app)


* DNA polymerse will detect unfitting bonds and remove leftover RNA primer bootstrap units to repair them in a process called "proofreading." DNA polimersease is assisted with "glue" ligase to help the DNA polymerease pick out and replace problematic/unneeded nucleotides and perhaps their neighbors. This is where the Ogazaki fragments get joined.



Stage of DNA Replication
Main purpose of this step
Key enzymes and structures involved 
Outcome of this process






The unwinded DNA is primed to help DNA polymerase’s replication process
Primase is responsible for priming the DNA strand for replication. 
Working in conjunction in the rejoining step below, a DNA molecule will be ready to be transcribed.
Unwinded DNA is broken and rejoined
The unwinded DNA is broken and rejoined in order to reduce strain caused by unzipping.
Topoisomerase is responsible for relieving unwinding-induced strain.


The resulting DNA is ready to be read from the 3’ to 5’ end in order to synthesize a new strand 5’ to 3’.
Actually replicating







The DNA is replicated via fitting the pairing nucleotides against the primed DNA
DNA polymerase, in addition to the primer RNAs aforementioned, perform this process.
Two new sets of DNA ready to be checked and later utilised.
Proofreading







Replicated DNA is checked for any irregularities + patched as needed in order to prevent error
