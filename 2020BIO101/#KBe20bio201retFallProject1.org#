** Notes

*** Target Processes

**** Enzyme catalysis

**** Protein-ligand binding

**** signal transduction

**** allosteric regulation

*** Folding Simulation Methods

**** all-atome molecular dynamics (MD)

     - Obtains all desired information regarding the kinetics and thermodynamics

***** Time scale bottleneck

     - very slow (supercomputers -> microseconds of simulation)
     - require microsecond to milisecond time scales

****** optimizations
       
******* conformational sampling?
        - retains atomistic representation of the system

******* Kinetic trapping and thourough sampling of conformational space techn
