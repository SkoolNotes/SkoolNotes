  =\textgreater{} replication will need a polymeraese; but the source
  and mechanism is dependent on viral genome structure/composition
\end{itemize}

\textbf{DNA Viruses}

\emph{How are viral mRNAs produced from the viral genome?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Viral DNA enters, through RNA polymerase II in the host cell, mRNA is
  produced
\item
  mRNAs then read by ribosomes, and there we go
\end{itemize}

\emph{What serves as the templates for viral genome replication?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Viral DNA serves as template for host cell DNA polymerase
\item
  Viral genome copied repeatedly
\item
  Virus, then, \textbf{will be replicated within the nucleus} due to it
  needing the polymerase to copy DNA
\end{itemize}

Except! Poxvirade carry their own polymerase, so they replicate in the
cytoplasm.

\textbf{RNA Viruses}

-Strand RNA: template RNA (less easy to be detected)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  double-stranded RNA viron =\textgreater{} (+, a.k.a. sense) strand

  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{What serves as the templates for viral genome replication?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  RNA viruses does not need host-cell polymeraese to copy RNA
\item
  They come with polymerase that\ldots{}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    with dsRNA; takes +ssRNA and makes -ssRMA; combining the two to
    produce dsRNA
  \item
    with +ssRNA, takes +ssRNA and makes temporary -ssRNA which makes
    more +ssRNA
  \item

\textbf{Viruses that have the ability to intergrate into the chromosomes

To make this happen, the virus needs\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Reverse Transcriptase}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Transcript RNA to double-stranded RNA
  \item
    Take double-stranded RNA to turn into DNA
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Integrase}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Force insert the DNA into the genome of the host cell
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

And because of the fact that viral DNA is now in cellular DNA, these
viruses' DNAs are hard to get rid of.

And this is why we can't cure HIV.

Virus, in this case, spread through cell duplication

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Proviral region on the DNA, every time the ribosome comes across it,
  makes a new viron
\item
  These components are then assembled, sent, etc. as usual
\item
  Because of the fact that the ribosome needs to, well, come across the
  bit of DNA for this to work, the virons are made slowly by "trickling
  out.
\end{itemize}

and transcription.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

  The process of \textbf{Transcription} involves taking the DNA,
  separating it, and copying its corresponding pairs to RNA
\item
  The process of \textbf{Translation} involves taking the RNA and making
  proteins.
\end{itemize}

Occasionally, the RNA is what we want to end up with, so then obviously
we no longer need the process of Translation.

Subunit =\textgreater{} form a holoenzyme to unwind DNA * Sigma subunit
informs the enzyme where to find a promoter (beginning of binding) *

Pre-process the mRNA.

\textbf{Prokaryotes does not do this!} Prokarotes' coding sequence
always makes a full protein, so we just start at promoter and end at
terminator and make a protein!

In Eukaryotic DNA\ldots{}

Between Promoter and Terminator, \textbf{Exon} and \textbf{Intron}
alternate. Exon is coding, whereas Intron is non-coding and works as
metadata.

After reading the intron, they are spliced out during mRNA processing
=\textgreater{} done by the ``splicesome''. The mRNA, after splicing, is
``capped and tailed'' to mark pre-processing completion, at which point
they leave the nucleus + go to the ribosome.

\hypertarget{translation-rna-directed-polypeptide-synthesis}{%

Mature mRNA sent to ribosome. mRNA must travel to the cytoplasm in the
Eukarotes to catch the RNA, whereas in prokarotes they don't have to go
anywhere.

Ribosomes has two units: 50S unit + 30S unit =\textgreater{} they come
together whenever a mRNA needs it. Each contained specialized rRNA +
tTRNA to catalyze attachment of and carry amino acids + adapt the
incoming mRNA respectively.

\textbf{Note! The beginning of mRNA is not translated.} There a portion
on the 5' end of the mRNA (starts with AGGAGG) --- about 170 nuclotides
in humans, and shorter in bacteria --- that's called UTR (untranslated
region.) This region helps ribosomes bind to it + stablize the binds.

  3 protein factors IF1, IF2, IF3 forms a complex for transcription by
  binding to a subunit on the ribosome
\item
  Methionine-carrying tRNA binds to the start of the mRNA, which forms
  the initiation complex. This is typically removed after translation if
  not coded for (f M-A amino acid pair coded for, methonine removed; but
  if M-L pairs coded for, methonine not removed.)
\item
  A-site: translates mRNA to tRNA --- anti-codon pairs
\item
  P-site: amino acid dumped from tRNA to the actual chain being built
\item
  Spent tRNA ejected to the E-site, which is then recycled
\item
  Catalyst tRNA combines with rRNA to catalyze amino acid peptide bond
\item
  Each codon (group of 3 units in tRNA), matches a specific
