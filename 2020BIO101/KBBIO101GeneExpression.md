# Notes
### Overview
 - Organisms turn genes on and off which is called Gene Expression
	 - This can be done in response to external and internal signals
		 - These signals are based off of environmental factors
	 - This is also be done in order to specialize cells
		 - Certain cells need certain genes to preform their specific role


 ### Differential Gene Expression
  - Human Cells can express about 20% of it's protein coded genes at any given time
  - Most cells contain the same genome
	  - Each cell type must use specific parts of this genome
		  - This is called Differential gene expression
	  - Exception would be cells of the immune system
  - Due to the importance of gene expression when it has issues it can affect the organism significantly
  - Process of Gene expression in a Eukaryotic cell
	  - Chromatin (DNA unpacking) -->
	  - RNA processing -->
	  - Transport to cytoplasm -->
	  - Translation -->
	  - Protein processing -->
	  - Transport to cellular destination-->
  - This process can often be equated to transcription for Prokaryote cells
