# Notes
### Overview
 - Organisms turn genes on and off which is called Gene Expression
	 - This can be done in response to external and internal signals
		 - These signals are based off of environmental factors
	 - This is also be done in order to specialize cells
		 - Certain cells need certain genes to preform their specific role

 ### Differential Gene Expression
  - Human Cells can express about 20% of it's protein coded genes at any given time
  - Most cells contain the same genome
	  - Each cell type must use specific parts of this genome
		  - This is called Differential gene expression
	  - Exception would be cells of the immune system
  - Due to the importance of gene expression when it has issues it can affect the organism significantly
  - Process of Gene expression in a Eukaryotic cell
	  - Chromatin (DNA unpacking) -->
	  - RNA processing -->
	  - Transport to cytoplasm -->
	  - Translation -->
	  - Protein processing -->
	  - Transport to cellular destination-->
  - This process can often be equated to transcription for Prokaryote cells

### Regulation of Chromatin Structure
 - The chromatin structure itself allows for the regulation of gene expression
	 - This is partially due to the location of the promoter
 - Chemical modifications to the histone proteins can affect the structure
	 - This in turn can affect gene expression
	 - Histone proteins are the proteins in which the DNA is wrapped
	 - There are many types of modifications that can take place
		 - Histone acetylation can tend to promote transcriptions by opening up the chromatin
		 - Additional methyl groups tend to close up the chromatin and decrease transcription
	 - DNA methylation occurs in most plants and animals as well as fungi
	 - Methylated DNA will stay methalated through cell divisions
		 - This accounts for genomic imprinting
		 - These epigenetic markers can be inherited
			 - There is continually more evidence for the importance of epigentics in gene expression
### Regulation of Transcription
 - Chromatin changes are not permanent and can be reversed
 - The next step of gene expression regulation is in the transcription factors
	 - These either allow for or inhibit transcription
 - These factors usually bind to proteins, but some of them bind to DNA
 - High levels of transcription factors created for specific genes are associated with another protein thought creatively of as specific transcription factors
 - Gene expression is dramatically increased or decreased by the binding of specific transcription factors
	 - These are either activators or repressors
 - There are many transcription factors
	 - Repressors act in many different ways, but some bind directly to control element DNA blocking activator binding
	 - Others interfere with the activator itself
