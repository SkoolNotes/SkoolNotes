- Sugar types
	- Sucrose is a disaccharide
		- one glucose and one fructose
		- cane sugar is a disaccharide
			- C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁
- Summarize observational data
	- Beads shrivel in all except water and sugar
	- Change in water is minimal
- Hypothesis
	- Sugar bonds to each other and does dehydration synthesis? therefore more water
		- Therefore water goes into the beads?
	- Polarity of molecules?
- Things that would be helpful
	- What is the concentration of the water in the beads?
	- What is the actual concentration of sugar? 75g water meaning 75g total solution?
