# Viral Genetic Shift + Viral Genetic Drift

## Genetic SHift
Whole segments of genome exchange abruptly as two flu viruses infect the same cell to create a new strand.

## Genetic Drift
Single/groups of nucleotides flip slowly over time due to mistakes in [[KBhBIO101RNAReplication]].

The former is an environment-dependent process, where the latter is able to be modeled as it is due to transcription mistake.
