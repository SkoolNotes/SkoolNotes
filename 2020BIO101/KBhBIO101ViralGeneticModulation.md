### Viral Genetic Shift + Viral Genetic Drift

**Shift** => whole segments of genome exchange abruptly as two flu viruses infect the same cell to create a new strand.

**Drift** => single/groups of nucleotides flip slowly over time.

The former is an environment-dependent process, where the latter is able to be modeled as it is due to transcription mistake.
