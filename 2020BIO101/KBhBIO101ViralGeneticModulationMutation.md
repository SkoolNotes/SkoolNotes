# Viral Genetic Mutations

## Genetic Shift
Whole segments of genome exchange abruptly as two flu viruses infect the same cell to create a new strand.  There are two mechnisms by which happens â€” ( #ASK ) the **crossing-over mechnism** and **genome segment reassortment** 

### Crossing-over 
Self-mixing of #ask #ask #ask of either polyprotein sections or ozaki fragments (I think the latter) 

### genome segment reassortment** (I think that's where two viruses coinfect the same cell, causing cross-talk in swapping segments)

<!--In this case, Viruses recombinate by crossing-over mechanism (remember how [[KBhBIO101Retroviruses]] HIV need protease to cut parts? when that shuffles) or genome segment reassortment (two viruses cross-talk by infecting the same host cell). Think! the flu-->

## Genetic Drift
This usually occurs due an error in a polymerase-driven process, where single/groups of nucleotides flip slowly over time due to mistakes in [[KBhBIO101RNAReplication]].

The former is an environment-dependent process, where the latter is able to be modeled as it is due to predictable transcription mistake.

- **RNA viruses** could mutate more because it does not have checks
- **More complex+largest viruses** (DNA viruses) harder to mutate
