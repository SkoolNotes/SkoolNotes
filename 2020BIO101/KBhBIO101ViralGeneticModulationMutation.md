# Viral Genetic Mutations

## Genetic Shift
Whole segments of genome exchange abruptly as two flu viruses infect the same cell to create a new strand.  There are two mechnisms by which happens â€” ( #ASK ) the **crossing-over mechnism** and **genome segment reassortment** 

### Crossing-over 
Self-mixing of ozaki fragments during viral recombination in the [[KBhBIO101DNAReplication]] process cause sudden mutations

### Genome Segment Reassortment
Two viruses coinfect the same cell, causing cross-talk in swapping segments

## Genetic Drift
This usually occurs due an error in a polymerase-driven process, where single/groups of nucleotides flip slowly over time due to mistakes in [[KBhBIO101RNAReplication]].

The former is an environment-dependent process, where the latter is able to be modeled as it is due to predictable transcription mistake.

- **RNA viruses** could mutate more because it does not have checks
- **More complex+largest viruses** (DNA viruses) harder to mutate
