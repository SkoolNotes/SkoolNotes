# Viral Genetic Mutations

## Genetic Shift
Whole segments of genome exchange abruptly as two flu viruses infect the same cell to create a new strand. This usually occurs due an error in a polymerase-driven process.

## Genetic Drift
Single/groups of nucleotides flip slowly over time due to mistakes in [[KBhBIO101RNAReplication]]. Viruses recombinate without or genome segment reassortment by crossing-over mechanism (two viruses cross-talk by infecting the same host cell) or genome segment reassortment (remember how [[KBhBIO101Retroviruses]] HIV need protease to cut parts? when that shuffles). Think! the flu

The former is an environment-dependent process, where the latter is able to be modeled as it is due to transcription mistake.

- **RNA viruses** could mutate more because it does not have checks
- **More complex+largest viruses** (DNA viruses) harder to mutate
