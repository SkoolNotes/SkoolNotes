# Overview of Human Diseases
A lecture by Paul.

**Disease** is an abnormal condition that causes impairment in/loss of function of an organism (a.k.a. decreased fitness) that is not due to immediate external injury.
	
* What causes human disease?
	* Infectious agents
	* Deficiency disorders
	* Heritable factors
	* Physiological disorders (immunodeficiency, autoimmune disorders, allergies, etc.)
	
## Congenital vs. Acquired disease

Congenital diseases => diseases present at birth due to DNA abnormalities / pregnancy pathological issues

Acquired diseases => diseases that begin during lifetime, including...

* Microrganism invasion => "infectios diseases"
* Autoimmune reaction
* Nutrient deficiency
* Mechanical wear
* Ingestion of noxious chemicals

**Infectious diseases actually smaller on the causes of death in the US**

* Heart disease => wear + deficiency 
* Cancer => heritable + DNA
* Unintentional injuries => not a disease
* Chronic respitory disease => wear
* Stroke => not a disease
* Alhetimer disease => wear
* Diabetes => autoimmune, nutrient, wear
* Influenca <= **here, finally, an infections disease.**

## Disease causing agents
* **Protozoan** => single-celled eukaryotes
* **Fungal** => single/multi-celled eukarotyes
* **Bacteria** => single-celled prokaryotes
* **Viral** => acellular parasitic infectious agent
* **Helminuthus** => multicellular worms
* **Prions** => acellular misfolded proteins
* **Viroids** => infections nucleic acids w/o protein coat to make virus

## Pathogenicity + Virulence

All of disease-causing things have two marks for it

**Pathoginecity** => relative capacity to cause disease

**Virulence** =>
