# Overview of Human Diseases
A lecture by Paul.

#flo #disorganized 

**Disease** is an abnormal condition that causes impairment in/loss of function of an organism (a.k.a. decreased fitness) that is not due to immediate external injury.
	
* What causes human disease?
	* Infectious agents
	* Deficiency disorders
	* Heritable factors
	* Physiological disorders (immunodeficiency, autoimmune disorders, allergies, etc.)
	
## Congenital vs. Acquired disease

Congenital diseases => diseases present at birth due to DNA abnormalities / pregnancy pathological issues

Acquired diseases => diseases that begin during lifetime, including...

* Microrganism invasion => "infectios diseases"
* Autoimmune reaction
* Nutrient deficiency
* Mechanical wear
* Ingestion of noxious chemicals

**Infectious diseases actually smaller on the causes of death in the US**

* Heart disease => wear + deficiency 
* Cancer => heritable + DNA
* Unintentional injuries => not a disease
* Chronic respitory disease => wear
* Stroke => not a disease
* Alhetimer disease => wear
* Diabetes => autoimmune, nutrient, wear
* Influenca <= **here, finally, an infections disease.**

## Disease causing agents
* **Protozoan** => single-celled eukaryotes
* **Fungal** => single/multi-celled eukarotyes
* **Bacteria** => single-celled prokaryotes
* **Viral** => acellular parasitic infectious agent
* **Helminuthus** => multicellular worms
* **Prions** => acellular misfolded proteins
* **Viroids** => infections nucleic acids w/o protein coat to make virus

## Pathogenicity + Virulence

**Pathoginecity** => relative capacity to cause disease

- Non-pathogenic agents => no diesease
- Primary pathogens => yes disease
- Opportunistic pathogens => yes disease only when it can, for instance, in immunocompromised individuals

**Virulence** => numerical measures for pathonicity

- Measured experimentally with LD50 + ED50

## Overview of various diseases

### Protozoan

* **Protozoan factors** => direction pathogenisis leading to tissue damage
* **Host-mediated factors** => immune evation + escape mechnisms + immunalsupression

Adaptable!!

### Fungal

* **Fungal factors** => many shapes and very adaptable, colud produced specialized enzymes to take root in body
* **Host-mediated factors** => cause immunocomprimzation, acquired though inhalation, etc.

### Bacteria

* **Bacterial-induced toxicity** => produces toxins + has hard capsule cell
* **Host-mediated factors** => may develop host resistance, could compete for resources, and could be grown introcellularly

## Bacteria causing diseases

**Biofilm formation**

- Communities of bacteria could work together by adhering and exchanging information
- Bacterial could perform quorum sensing => exchange of information with each other + recognize various members of their group

### Fighting bacterial infections

**Antibiotics** => drugs with selective toxicity for specific bacterial types

Act by...

* Disrupting membrane + cell wall integrity
* Selectively target + impair bacterial ribosomes
* Block bacterial DNA replication/transcription
* Inhibit bacterial metabolism

## Viruses causing diseases
**Viruses: acellular macromolecular assemblies**

* Contain protein coat called capsid
* DNA or RNA, but not both
* Are obligate parasites that could only replicate within host

	
* Assembled and mature viral particles => virions, which contain...
	* Capsid
	* Genetic material
	* Occationally outside lipid layer 
	
=> Viruses exist on the nanometre scale, but they are difference in share and size

### Structure of viruses
* **All contain**
	* Capsid => structural protein coat
	* Genome => RNA/DNA; but not both
* **Some contain**
	* Membraneous-enclosed capsid => envelope
	* Externally-facisg host-cell fusion proteins => spikes
	* Viral genome replication enzymes => prlymerases
	* Other proteins for fun => enzymes, motor proteins, transcription factors, host-cell interacting proteins, etc.
	
### Two types of virus 
* **Prokaryotic-infecting viruses**
	* Variety of shapes
	* Complex and prolate shapes
	* Has, sometimes complex shapes! a la [this image](Screen Shot 2020-10-12 at 10.49.04 PM.png)
* **Eukarotic-infecting viruses**
	* Much more "boring" in terms of shape
	* Icosahedral/spherecial outside
	* Enveloped constructions => envelope protein layer outside, spherical inside
	* Helical/Cylindrical/Bullet shapes, too!
	* Often single patterns assemble together to create symmetric shape that creates the whole of the virus 


### Viral Life Cycle
1. Attachment => protein contact between virus and host
2. Viral entry/Uncoating => shedding the protein layer
3. Biosynthesis => make baby viruses
	1. Genome Replication: transcribe DNA/RNA
	2. Genome Expression: read DNA/RNA to make proteins
4.  Viral genome integration => retrovirus only
5.  Assembly => put it all togethr
6.  Viral Exit => mature virons leave

#### Viral Entry

*Option 1: Direct Injection/insertion*

- Insert genome through the bi-layer
- Leave the rest behind
- Tada!

*Option 2: Endocytosis*

- Trick the host cell into introducing the virus as food
- Endocytosis!
- Bam

*Option 3: Fusion*
 
 - Virus fuse with cell membrane
 - Shed the protein coat once in
 - Shazam!

**All of these involve attachment first, which usually takes two steps.**

This process causes the organism-specific response to viruses:

1. Attachment: adhere roughly to random sugar proteins
2. Binding: roll over slowly, and bind to the entry receptor it needs

#### Uncoating
* Virus triggers *early endosome*
	* Causes pH dependent protein denaturation
	* Causing the capsid to fall apart
	* Triggering *late endosome* => releasing genome

#### Viral Replication
Key questions:

- **How are viral mRNAs produced from the viral genome?** => virus will hijack the ribosomes in the host cells. So, it is more important to ask how the mRNAs are produced to tell ribosomes what to do
- **What serves as the template for viral genome replication** => replication will need a polymeraese; but the source and mechanism is dependent on viral genome structure/composition

**DNA Viruses**

*How are viral mRNAs produced from the viral genome?*

- Viral DNA enters, through RNA polymerase II in the host cell, mRNA is produced
- mRNAs then read  by ribosomes, and there we go

*What serves as the templates for viral genome replication?*

- Viral DNA serves as template for host cell DNA polymerase
- Viral genome copied repeatedly
- Virus, then, **will be replicated within the nucleus** due to it needing the polymerase to copy DNA

Except! Poxvirade carry their own polymerase, so they replicate in the cytoplasm.

**RNA Viruses**

*How are viral mRNAs produced from the viral genome?*

- double-stranded RNA viron => (+, a.k.a. sense) strand could be translated directly by using as mRNA
- +-stranded RNA => same idea as above
- - strand RNA => virus comes with polymerase that convert -ssRNA to +ssRNA. Then, same idea as above


*What serves as the templates for viral genome replication?*

* RNA viruses does not need host-cell polymeraese to copy RNA
* They come with polymerase that...
	* with dsRNA; takes +ssRNA and makes -ssRMA; combining the two to produce dsRNA
	* with +ssRNA, takes +ssRNA and makes temporary -ssRNA which makes more +ssRNA
	* with -ssRNA, takes -ssRNA, and makes +ssRNA by
