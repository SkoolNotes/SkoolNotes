# Overview of Human Diseases
A lecture by the Legendary Dr. Paul Hauser. [Slides are here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b2RetU6iGsd_h4Msb2SV-_WznNXSREbsPpfdY-LgJZs/edit#slide=id.ga6d683dbbf_0_338)

**Preventing Retroviruses**

* Most advanced: HAART (Highly-Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy)
	- Cocktail drug works together for inhibition
	- Two drugs to stop intergration, one to stop protease (viron maturation)
	- Could develop resistance

### Viral Genome vs Mutation Rate

- RNA viruses could mutate more because it does not have checks
- More complex+largest viruses harder to mutate

**Genetic drift** — viruses mutate due to polymerase error

**Genetic shift** — viruses recombinate without mutating by crossing-over mechanism or genome segment reassortment. Think! the flu

 
## Why are viruses bad

Damage host cells/tissues by...

* Reducing gene expression capacity
* Depleting cellular resources
* Causing cell lysis (to explode)
* Promoting tumorigenisis — cancer
* Creating damaging immunological response

## Preventing Viruses

Let's talk about **Remdesivir**! A drug developed by Pfizer that's used to combat Ebola + influenza viral replication.

 Modified nucleotide triphosphate which adds onto the RNA strand copied by the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase carried by viruses
 
* Pretends + gets inserted as a nucleotide
* Once added onto the RNA chain, jams further actual nucleotides from being inserted

 _Could_ but usually does not jam up normal RNA polymerase which does normal transcription
 
* Inhibiting transcription in the short term won't kill you immediately
* So, we hurt normal cell transcription a little in order to rid of the virus
* Need hospital treatment for regular and safe dosing for this exact reason

* Viral proteins are usually easy to assemble

**Question: how are proteins made in the viral genome**

* No viruses produce ribosomes
* Ribosomes become centrally important for the virus
* What serves as the template to make new virus copies

Viruses attempt to overwhelm the enzyme to entry.


**DNA** viruses are "less complex", in that as long as they are able to get into the nucleaus, the rest would just be the body's work automatically.
