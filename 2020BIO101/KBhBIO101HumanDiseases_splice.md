### Structure of viruses
* **All contain**
	* Capsid => structural protein coat
	* Genome => RNA/DNA; but not both
* **Some contain**
	* Membraneous-enclosed capsid => envelope
	* Externally-facisg host-cell fusion proteins => spikes
	* Viral genome replication enzymes => prlymerases
	* Other proteins for fun => enzymes, motor proteins, transcription factors, host-cell interacting proteins, etc.
	
### Two types of virus 
* **Prokaryotic-infecting viruses**
	* Variety of shapes
	* Complex and prolate shapes
	* Has, sometimes complex shapes! a la [this image](Screen Shot 2020-10-12 at 10.49.04 PM.png)
* **Eukarotic-infecting viruses**
	* Much more "boring" in terms of shape
	* Icosahedral/spherecial outside
	* Enveloped constructions => envelope protein layer outside, spherical inside
	* Helical/Cylindrical/Bullet shapes, too!
	* Often single patterns assemble together to create symmetric shape that creates the whole of the virus 


### Viral Life Cycle
1. Attachment => protein contact between virus and host
2. Viral entry/Uncoating => shedding the protein layer
3. Biosynthesis => make baby viruses
	1. Genome Replication: transcribe DNA/RNA
	2. Genome Expression: read DNA/RNA to make proteins
4.  Viral genome integration => retrovirus only
5.  Assembly => put it all togethr
6.  Viral Exit => mature virons leave

#### Viral Entry

*Option 1: Direct Injection/insertion*

- Insert genome through the bi-layer
- Leave the rest behind
- Tada!

*Option 2: Endocytosis*

- Trick the host cell into introducing the virus as food
- Endocytosis!
- Bam

*Option 3: Fusion*
 
 - Virus fuse with cell membrane
 - Shed the protein coat once in
 - Shazam!

**All of these involve attachment first, which usually takes two steps.**

This process causes the organism-specific response to viruses:

1. Attachment: adhere roughly to random sugar proteins
2. Binding: roll over slowly, and bind to the entry receptor it needs

#### Uncoating
* Virus triggers *early endosome*
	* Causes pH dependent protein denaturation
	* Causing the capsid to fall apart
	* Triggering *late endosome* => releasing genome

#### Viral Replication
Key questions:

- **How are viral mRNAs produced from the viral genome?** => virus will hijack the ribosomes in the host cells. So, it is more important to ask how the mRNAs are produced to tell ribosomes what to do
- **What serves as the template for viral genome replication** => replication will need a polymeraese; but the source and mechanism is dependent on viral genome structure/composition

**DNA Viruses**

*How are viral mRNAs produced from the viral genome?*

- Viral DNA enters, through RNA polymerase II in the host cell, mRNA is produced
- mRNAs then read  by ribosomes, and there we go

*What serves as the templates for viral genome replication?*

- Viral DNA serves as template for host cell DNA polymerase
- Viral genome copied repeatedly
- Virus, then, **will be replicated within the nucleus** due to it needing the polymerase to copy DNA

Except! Poxvirade carry their own polymerase, so they replicate in the cytoplasm.

**RNA Viruses**

*How are viral mRNAs produced from the viral genome?*

#### Packaging

Does not require ATP. Just sealed in.

#### Viral Exis

**Lysis**

Replicate so much that the membrane burst.

**Budding**

Trigger...

- Trigger extocytosis
- Meanwhile, send virus's own spikes to the membrane
- On exit by extocytosis, steal a part of the newly-spikey membrane with it to serve as new casing

### Viral Genetic Shift + Viral Genetic Drift

**Shift** => whole segments of genome exchange abruptly as two flu viruses infect the same cell to create a new strand.

**Drift** => single/groups of nucleotides flip slowly over time.

The former is an environment-dependent process, where the latter is able to be modeled as it is due to transcription mistake.

### Retroviruses + How to Stop Them
**Viruses that have the ability to intergrate into the chromosomes of the host cell**

#### Early Events

* Viruses is uncoated, and uses an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to turn ssRNA to cDNA, and finally into dsDNA
* Then, the enzyme integrase threads the viral dsDNA into the cell's nucleaus
* HIV protease cuts HIV polyproteins into individual parts ready for budding

#### Late Events

* Proviral region is transcribed slowly whenever ribosome comes across it by the host DNA polymerase II to make viral proteins + replicate the viral genome
* Components are later exported, assembled, and slowly released through budding

To make this happen, the virus needs...

- **Reverse Transcriptase**
	- Transcript RNA to double-stranded RNA
	- Take double-stranded RNA to turn into DNA
- **Integrase**
	- Force insert the DNA into the genome of the host cell

And because of the fact that viral DNA is now in cellular DNA, these viruses' DNAs are hard to get rid of.

And this is why we can't cure HIV.

Virus, in this case, spread through cell duplication

* Proviral region on the DNA, every time the ribosome comes across it, makes a new viron
* These components are then assembled, sent, etc. as usual
* Because of the fact that the ribosome needs to, well, come across the bit of DNA for this to work, the virons are made slowly by "trickling out.

**Preventing Retroviruses**

* Prevent Fusion `gp120`, `gp41`, `CCR5`
* Prevent reverse transcription `RT`
* Prevent intergration via intergrease `IN`
* Prevent viron maturation `PR`

![stophiv.png](stophiv.png)

* Most advanced: HAART (Highly-Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy)
	- Cocktail drug works together for inhibition
	- Two drugs to stop intergration, one to stop protease (viron maturation)
	- Could develop resistance

### Viral Genome vs Mutation Rate

![Screen Shot 2020-10-12 at 11.24.39 PM.png](Screen Shot 2020-10-12 at 11.24.39 PM.png)

- RNA viruses could mutate more because it does not have checks
- More complex+largest viruses harder to mutate

**Genetic drift** — viruses mutate due to polymerase error

**Genetic shift** — viruses recombinate without mutating by crossing-over mechanism or genome segment reassortment. Think! the flu

 
## Why are viruses bad

Damage host cells/tissues by...

* Reducing gene expression capacity
* Depleting cellular resources
* Causing cell lysis (to explode)
* Promoting tumorigenisis — cancer
* Creating damaging immunological response

## Preventing Viruses

Let's talk about **Remdesivir**! A drug developed by Pfizer that's used to combat Ebola + influenza viral replication.

 Modified nucleotide triphosphate which adds onto the RNA strand copied by the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase carried by viruses
 
* Pretends + gets inserted as a nucleotide
* Once added onto the RNA chain, jams further actual nucleotides from being inserted

 _Could_ but usually does not jam up normal RNA polymerase which does normal transcription
 
* Inhibiting transcription in the short term won't kill you immediately
* So, we hurt normal cell transcription a little in order to rid of the virus
* Need hospital treatment for regular and safe dosing for this exact reason

* Viral proteins are usually easy to assemble

**Question: how are proteins made in the viral genome**

* No viruses produce ribosomes
* Ribosomes become centrally important for the virus
* What serves as the template to make new virus copies

Viruses attempt to overwhelm the enzyme to entry.


**DNA** viruses are "less complex", in that as long as they are able to get into the nucleaus, the rest would just be the body's work automatically.
