The *COMT* gene, or catechol-O-methyltransferase, encodes the *COMT* enzyme which is responsible for breaking down neurotransmitters the brain's prefrontal cortex. More specifically, it acts as a catalyst for the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. This process, called O-methylation, leads to the degradation of the aforementioned neurotransmitters. The *COMT* enzyme also effects the metabolism of exogenous substances, but that
