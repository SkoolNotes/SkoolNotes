# Mutation and Inheritance
## Cell Division, Cell Cycle & It's Regulation
**Each cell lives and reproduced on a cycle; unsurprisingly, this is called the [[KBhBIO101CellLifecycle]]! **

- These cell cycles create [[KBhBIO101GeneticVariation]], even in [[KBhBIO101Mitosis]], because yes!, in mitosis, there could be [[KBhBIO101Mutations]] which introduce variation
- However [[KBhBIO101Mutations]] could cause cancer if left unchecked, so we have [[KBhBIO101CellCycleRegulation]] to keep this cycle check.

**At the end of the cell cycle, a little bit of a thing happens where the cell replicates (or makes offsprings, so not necessarily exact copies of) itself. This bit of a thing's called [[KBhBIO101CellReproduction]].**

- This reproduction process uses one of either [[KBhBIO101Mitosis]] (exact copy, for somatic cells (not sperm/egg) only) or 
- [[KBhBIO101Meiosis]] (half, randomly-mixed genetic info, for gametes (sperm/egg) only).

## Genetics and Inheritance
[[KBhBIO101GeneticVariation]] is like, really good. However, its woefully complicated and there are at least 3 ways I think of that it happens. 

DNA's sequence could vary by itself, and that will cause a [[KBhBIO101Mutations]], which is actually very rarely bad news bears.


-   Connecting sequence variation at the DNA level to protein function
-   Connecting protein function to expressed traits in organisms
	-   Given an individual with two particular alleles of a gene, what trait would you expect to see.
-   Connecting protein function and traits to inheritance patterns:
	-   Given parents with particular alleles of genes, what would you expect in their offspring and why.
