# Mutation and Inheritance
## Cell Division, Cell Cycle & It's Regulation
- Each cell lives and reproduced on a cycle; unsurprisingly, this is called the [[KBhBIO101CellCycle]]! 
- At the end of the cell cycle, a little bit of a thing happens where the cell replicates (or makes offsprings, so not necessarily exact copies of) itself. This bit of a thing's called [[KBhBIO101CellReproduction]]. 
	- This reproduction process uses one of either [[KBhBIO101Mitosis]] (exact copy, for somatic cells (not sperm/egg) only) or 
	- :[[KBhBIO101Meiosis]] (half, randomly-mixed genetic info, for gametes (sperm/egg) only).





-   The purpose and activities of each cell cycle phase
-   The importance of cell cycle checkpoints
-   The types and functions of cell cycle regulators



-   The organization of the human genome:
	-   The idea that genes and regulatory sequences are located on chromosomes
	-   The number of unique human chromosomes and how many chromosomes are in each somatic cell or gamete.
	-   The concept of alleles: what they are, their relation to genes and traits
-   The types of reproduction and how they relate to genetic variation
	-   Asexual
	-   Sexual 
		-   Difference between germline and somatic cells and how this relates to reproduction
-   The causes and consequences of mutations
	-   How different kinds of damage or mistakes can lead to mutation
	-   Different types of mutations at various scales, and how those could potentially impact proteins
	-   The connection between mutations and variations in traits/phenotypes
-   Meiosis as the mechanism that enables sexual reproduction and increases genetic variation in sexually reproducing organisms
	-   The purpose and activities of meiosis I and meiosis II, esp:
		-   Crossing over
		-   Independent assortment
		-   diploidâ†’ haploid chromosome reduction
	-   How meiosis differs from mitosis
	-   Mechanisms for genetic variation in offspring as compared to asexual reproduction
-   Genetics and inheritance
	-   Connecting sequence variation at the DNA level to protein function
	-   Connecting protein function to expressed traits in organisms
		-   Given an individual with two particular alleles of a gene, what trait would you expect to see.
	-   Connecting protein function and traits to inheritance patterns:
		-   Given parents with particular alleles of genes, what would you expect in their offspring and why.
