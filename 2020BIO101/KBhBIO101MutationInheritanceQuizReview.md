# Mutation and Inheritance
## Cell Division, Cell Cycle & It's Regulation
**Each cell lives and reproduced on a cycle; unsurprisingly, this is called the [[KBhBIO101CellLifecycle]]! **

- These cell cycles create [[KBhBIO101GeneticVariation]], even in [[KBhBIO101Mitosis]], because yes!, in mitosis, there could be [[KBhBIO101Mutations]] which introduce variation
- However [[KBhBIO101Mutations]] could cause cancer if left unchecked, so we have [[KBhBIO101CellCycleRegulation]] to keep this cycle check.
- At the end of the cell cycle, a little bit of a thing happens where the cell replicates (or makes offsprings, so not necessarily exact copies of) itself. This bit of a thing's called [[KBhBIO101CellReproduction]]. 
	- This reproduction process uses one of either [[KBhBIO101Mitosis]] (exact copy, for somatic cells (not sperm/egg) only) or 
	- [[KBhBIO101Meiosis]] (half, randomly-mixed genetic info, for gametes (sperm/egg) only).



-   The organization of the human genome:
	-   The idea that genes and regulatory sequences are located on chromosomes
	-   The concept of alleles: what they are, their relation to genes and traits
-   The types of reproduction and how they relate to genetic variation. Asexual vs sexual reproduction
	-   Mechanisms for genetic variation in offspring as compared to asexual reproduction
-   Genetics and inheritance
	-   Connecting sequence variation at the DNA level to protein function
	-   Connecting protein function to expressed traits in organisms
		-   Given an individual with two particular alleles of a gene, what trait would you expect to see.
	-   Connecting protein function and traits to inheritance patterns:
		-   Given parents with particular alleles of genes, what would you expect in their offspring and why.
