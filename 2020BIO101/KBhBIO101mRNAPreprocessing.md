# mRNA Pre-Processing

Between Promoter and Terminator, **Exon** and **Intron** alternate. Exon is coding, whereas Intron is non-coding and works as metadata.

After reading the intron, they are spliced out during mRNA processing => done by the "splicesome". The mRNA, after splicing, is "capped and tailed" to mark pre-processing completion, at which point they leave the nucleus + go to the ribosome.

## Slicing out the non-coding parts
* Begin by assembling helper proteins at intron-exon borders => "slicing factors"
* Other helping factor proteins come together and form the "splicesome" to do the splicing
* Splicesome splices by bringing exon ends together
* After it's done, the splicesome disintergrates

## Marking for Maturity
After the slicing is done, each finished mRNA is marked for maturity:

* 3' end => AAAAAA tail (using poly-adenine tailing enzyme)
* 5' end => GGGGGG cap (using guanine-capping enzyme)
