# Nucleic Acids

## Nucleic Acids

d-Oxy Ribone Nucleic Acid: DNA
Ribone Nucleic Acid: RNA

**All nucleic acids are comprised of monomer units that's synthesized together into polymers.** => Just like [[KBhBIO101Carbs]] or [[KBhBIO101AminoAcids]]

## 3 basic parts of a Nucleic Acid
- Backbone 
	- phosphate group
	- sugar (Ribos => sugar in RNA, di-oxy Ribos => sugar in HNA)
		- In di-oby Ribos: a OH pair is replaced with a hydrogen **only in one position.** Hence "di-oxy"
- nitrogenous base
	- Bases in DNA
		- A, T, G, C
	- Bases in RNA
		- A, U, G, C

How do we make nucleic acids? Can you guess? Huh? **Dehydration synthesis!** #TODO make that actually a note, at this pont

5' => one end of an RNA/DNA part

3' => another end of a RNA/DNA part

* DNA is supposed to be double stranded
* RNA is supposed to be single stranded
 
 DNA is *anti-parallel* to each other => 5' to 3' backbone parallel to 3' to 5' backbone
 
 Temp copies of genome is RNA, permanent record in DNA
