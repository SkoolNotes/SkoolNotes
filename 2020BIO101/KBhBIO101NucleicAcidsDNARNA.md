# DNA/RNA

## Nucleic Acids

d-Oxy Ribone Nucleic Acid: DNA
Ribone Nucleic Acid: RNA

**All nucleic acids are comprised of monomer units that's synthesized together into polymers.** => Just like [[KBhBIO101Carbs]] or [[KBhBIO101AminoAcids]]

## 3 basic parts of a Nucleic Acid
Two parts of the backbone (phosphate and sugar) + a nitrogenous base that labels what type of nucleotide this is.

### Backbone 
- phosphate group
- sugar (Ribos => sugar in RNA, di-oxy Ribos => sugar in DNA)=> In di-oby Ribos: a OH pair is replaced with a hydrogen **only in one position.** Hence "di-oxy"

### nitrogenous base
- Bases in DNA
	- A, T, G, C
- Bases in RNA
	- A, U, G, C

How do we make nucleic acids? Can you guess? Huh? **Dehydration synthesis!**

## Shapes of the DNA
### DNA/RNA Primality
- 5' => one end of an RNA/DNA part (connection from the phosphate group)
- 3' => another end of a RNA/DNA part (connection from the third carbon on the sugar counting from left)

**As in...**
![DNA 5 prime to three prime](5primeto3prime.png)

* DNA is supposed to be double stranded
* RNA is supposed to be single stranded
 
 DNA is *anti-parallel* to each other => 5' to 3' backbone parallel to 3' to 5' backbone
 
 Temp copies of genome is RNA, permanent record in DNA
 
 ## The Central Dogma
 The process of the central dogma is a rough path by which DNA is converted into Proteins. This helps us understand how proteins are made in a cell, and also how viruses could hijack this process to make themselves.
