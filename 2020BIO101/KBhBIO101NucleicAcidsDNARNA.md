# Nucleic Acids

## Nucleic Acids

d-Oxy Ribone Nucleic Acid: DNA
Ribone Nucleic Acid: RNA

**All nucleic acids are comprised of monomer units that's synthesized together into polymers.** => Just like [[KBhBIO101Carbs]] or [[KBhBIO101AminoAcids]]

## 3 basic parts of a Nucleic Acid
- phosphate group
- sugar (Ribos => sugar in RNA, di-oxy Ribos => sugar in HNA)
	- In di-oby Ribos: a OH pair is replaced with a hydrogen **only in one position.** Hence "di-oxy"
- nitrogenous base
	- 4 bases in DNA
		- A, T, G, C
		-
