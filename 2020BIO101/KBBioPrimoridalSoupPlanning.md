# General research 


start with: How did life start? 

content: theories of how life started,

explain miller-urey

end with we are not alone in the universe explanation:


life is inevitable 


## three theories

- Volcanic clay 
	- In simulated ancient seawater, clay forms a hydrogel -- a mass of microscopic spaces capable of soaking up liquids like a sponge. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/11/131105132027.htm
	- chemicals confined in those spaces could have carried out the complex reactions that formed proteins, DNA and eventually all the machinery that makes a living cell work. Clay hydrogels could have confined and protected those chemical processes until the membrane that surrounds living cells developed.
	-  theorists have shown that cytoplasm -- the interior environment of a cell -- behaves much like a hydrogel. 
	- Unlike surfactants, lipids are difficult to synthesize. Surfactants may transform into lipids. Apatite has been reported to be capable of catalyzing the formation of a proto-lipid [58]. https://www.intechopen.com/books/clay-minerals-in-nature-their-characterization-modification-and-application/role-of-clay-minerals-in-chemical-evolution-and-the-origin-of-life
	- Clay minerals might function as a primordial cell [4]. When clay minerals are deposited on the ocean floor (or dried), the particles form a pile, enclosing small spaces (Figure 6). It is conceivable that the small spaces behave like cells. Further, when clay minerals are dispersed in water, bubbles form in water or the surface of water, while the clay particles gather at the boundary between water and air, as shown in Figure 7 [57]. In such a case, clay minerals make a cell-like spherule.

# Outline 


Life is amazing, incredibly complex, the question becomes, 
how did it start? 


Three theories: 

volcanic clay 
deep sea vents 
tides of ponds 


But there's more than just theories: 

miller-urey experiment 


TRANSITION IDEA 

At home in the universe 


Life, is -- inevitable.
