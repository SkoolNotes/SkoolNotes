# General research 


start with: How did life start? 

content: theories of how life started,

explain miller-urey

end with we are not alone in the universe explanation:


life is inevitable 


## three theories

- Volcanic clay 
	- In simulated ancient seawater, clay forms a hydrogel -- a mass of microscopic spaces capable of soaking up liquids like a sponge. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/11/131105132027.htm
	- chemicals confined in those spaces could have carried out the complex reactions that formed proteins, DNA and eventually all the machinery that makes a living cell work. Clay hydrogels could have confined and protected those chemical processes until the membrane that surrounds living cells developed.
	-  theorists have shown that cytoplasm -- the interior environment of a cell -- behaves much like a hydrogel.












# Outline 


Life is amazing, incredibly complex, the question becomes, 
how did it start? 


Three theories: 

volcanic clay 
deep sea vents 
tides of ponds 


But there's more than just theories: 

miller-urey experiment 


TRANSITION IDEA 

At home in the universe 


Life, is -- inevitable.
