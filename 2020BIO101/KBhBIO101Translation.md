# Protein Translation

Mature mRNA sent to ribosome. mRNA must travel to the cytoplasm in the Eukarotes to catch the RNA, whereas in prokarotes they don't have to go anywhere.

Ribosomes has two units: 50S unit + 30S unit => they come together whenever a mRNA needs it. Each contained specialized rRNA + tTRNA to catalyze attachment of and carry amino acids + adapt the incoming mRNA respectively.

**Note! The beginning of mRNA is not translated.** There a portion on the 5' end of the mRNA (starts with AGGAGG) — about 170 nuclotides in humans, and shorter in bacteria — that's called UTR (untranslated region.) This region helps ribosomes bind to it + stablize the binds.

* 3 protein factors IF1, IF2, IF3 forms a complex for transcription by binding to a subunit on the ribosome
* Methionine-carrying tRNA binds to the start of the mRNA, which forms the initiation complex. This is typically removed after translation if not coded for (f M-A amino acid pair coded for, methonine removed; but if M-L pairs coded for, methonine not removed.)
* A-site: translates mRNA to tRNA — anti-codon pairs
* P-site: amino acid dumped from tRNA to the actual chain being built
* Spent tRNA ejected to the E-site, which is then recycled
* Catalyst tRNA combines with rRNA  to catalyze amino acid peptide bond
* Each codon (group of 3 units in tRNA), matches a specific [[KBhBIO101AminoAcids]]

Smaller ribosome unit grabs, larger attaches + forms amino acid

After the amino acids are assembled, it's time for [[KBe2020bio101refProteinFolding]]. See also [[KBhBIO101Proteins]].

=> Shaperones fold proteins, and if its finds proteins impossible to fold, it flags it using ubiquitin to send to the garbage
