  Volcanic clay

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In simulated ancient seawater, clay forms a hydrogel -- a mass of
    microscopic spaces capable of soaking up liquids like a sponge.
    https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/11/131105132027.htm
  \item
    chemicals confined in those spaces could have carried out the
    complex reactions that formed proteins, DNA and eventually all the
    machinery that makes a living cell work. Clay hydrogels could have
    confined and protected those chemical processes until the membrane
    that surrounds living cells developed.
  \item
    theorists have shown that cytoplasm -- the interior environment of a
    cell -- behaves much like a hydrogel.
  \item
    Unlike surfactants, lipids are difficult to synthesize. Surfactants
    may transform into lipids. Apatite has been reported to be capable
    of catalyzing the formation of a proto-lipid {[}58{]}.
    https://www.intechopen.com/books/clay-minerals-in-nature-their-characterization-modification-and-application/role-of-clay-minerals-in-chemical-evolution-and-the-origin-of-life
  \item
    Clay minerals might function as a primordial cell {[}4{]}. When clay
    minerals are deposited on the ocean floor (or dried), the particles
    form a pile, enclosing small spaces (Figure 6). It is conceivable
    that the small spaces behave like cells. Further, when clay minerals
    are dispersed in water, bubbles form in water or the surface of
    water, while the clay particles gather at the boundary between water
    and air, as shown in Figure 7 {[}57{]}. In such a case, clay
    minerals make a cell-like spherule.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

clay deposits and a type of hydrogel with form sponge like pockets

these pockets could have acted as early cells

cytoplasm behaves a lot like a hydrogel

some of the common minerals found in clay can help the formation of
proto lipids

pockets in clay deposits would be the perfect environment for early cell
formation

  Deep sea vents

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Deep under the Earth's seas, there are vents where seawater comes
    into contact with minerals from the planet's crust, reacting to
    create a warm, alkaline (high on the pH scale) environment
    containing hydrogen. The process creates mineral-rich chimneys with
    alkaline and acidic fluids, providing a source of energy that
    facilitates chemical reactions between hydrogen and carbon dioxide
    to form increasingly complex organic compounds.
    https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/11/191104112437.htm\#:\textasciitilde:text=Summary\%3A,vents
    rather than shallow pools.\&text=Some of the world's
    oldest,originated in such underwater vents.
  \item
    The researchers found that molecules with longer carbon chains
    needed heat in order to form themselves into a vesicle (protocell).
    An alkaline solution helped the fledgling vesicles keep their
    electric charge. A saltwater environment also proved helpful, as the
    fat molecules banded together more tightly in a salty fluid, forming
    more stable vesicles
  \item
    The researchers also point out that deep-sea hydrothermal vents are
    not unique to Earth.
  \item
    Authors of the new theory argue the environmental conditions in
    porous hydrothermal vents --- where heated, mineral-laden seawater
    spews from cracks in the ocean crust --- created a gradient in
    positively charged protons that served as a ``battery'' to fuel the
    creation of organic molecules and proto-cells. Later, primitive
    cellular pumps gradually evolved the ability to use a different type
    of gradient --- the difference in sodium particles inside and
    outside the cell --- as a battery to power the construction of
    complex molecules like proteins.

    sulfur, spewing from the geysers

  \end{itemize}
\item
  tides of ponds

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Researchers report that shallow bodies of water, on the order of 10
    centimeters deep, could have held high concentrations of what many
    scientists believe to be a key ingredient for jump-starting life on
    Earth: nitrogen.
    https://news.mit.edu/2019/earth-earliest-life-ponds-not-oceans-0412
  \item
    Atmospheric nitrogen consists of two nitrogen molecules, linked via
    a strong triple bond, that can only be broken by an extremely
    energetic event --- namely, lightning. ``Lightning is like a really
    intense bomb going off,'' Ranjan says. ``It produces enough energy
    that it breaks that triple bond in our atmospheric nitrogen gas, to
    produce nitrogenous oxides that can then rain down into water
    bodies.''
  \item
    In the ocean, ultraviolet light and dissolved iron would have made
    nitrogenous oxides far less available for synthesizing living
    organisms. In shallow ponds, however, life would have had a better
    chance to take hold. That's mainly because ponds have much less
    volume over which compounds can be diluted. As a result, nitrogenous
    oxides would have built up to much higher concentrations in ponds.
  \item
    In environments any deeper or larger, nitrogenous oxides would
    simply have been too diluted, precluding any participation in
    origin-of-life chemistry.
  \item
    {[}about rna{]} Having bonded in pairs at low tide, these newly
    formed molecular strands would then dissociate at high tide, when
    salt concentrations were reduced, providing what Lathe terms a
    self-replicating system.
    https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/moon-life-tides/\#:\textasciitilde:text=The
    ocean tides mirror life itself.\&text=Life emerged some 700
    million,tides were much more extreme.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  at home in the universe

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The chance that a single chemical is self replicating is very low
  \item
    however, this chemical is much more likely to another chemical
  \item
    as the number of chemicals and complexity increases, the likelihood
    that these chemicals will become cyclic increases exponentially\\
  \item
    life doesnt just become likely, it becomes inevitable.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Life is amazing, incredibly complex, the question becomes, how did it
start?

Three theories:

volcanic clay deep sea vents tides of ponds

But there's more than just theories:

miller-urey experiment

TRANSITION IDEA: While the results of this experiment seem profound,
looking at this same scenario from a mathematical perspective reveals
startling new conclusions

At home in the universe

Life, is -- inevitable.
