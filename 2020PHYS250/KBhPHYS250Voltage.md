# Voltage

## First, a geography thing.

In a topological map, you could probably guess that the **steepest path downwards/upwards is perpendicular to the lines.**

The constant voltage lines works in a similar way.

## Then, a Energy Thing.

If we have an object in the air

Object

~Air~

..ground..

What is that object's gravitation potential energy?

…  …  …

You will realize that I just asked a very dumb question. This is because that **energy must be relative to something.** You must _raise_ the object (giving us the $\Delta h$ part of $gpe = mg\Delta h$ to gain gravitational potential energy.

## Electric Potential

\definition{Electrical Potential}{$\frac{V}{C}$}

Voltage is a measure of how much electric potential energy (yes, it is an _energy_ (in $J$, joules)), would change per Couloub of energy that is moved through.

Recall the energy example above. When you raise an object of $1kg$ from a place with elevation ($\Delta h$) $10m$ to $100m$, you could represent the change in gravitation potential energy of that operation as $mg \Delta h_1 - mg \Delta h_0 = m(g \Delta h_1-g \Delta h_0) = 1kg(9.8\frac{m}{s^2} 100m - 9.8\frac{m}{s^2} 10m)$. Where, $g\Delta h_1$ is a unit $\frac{m^2}{s^2} = \frac{J}{kg}$. Proving this last relationship is left as an excercise to the reader.

Funny way to write it, I know. But, we could take the equation $m(g \Delta h_1-g \Delta h_0)$ and use it as a perfect analogy for using electric potential.

The amount of electric potential energy that would change by moving an object of charge $1C$ from a place with voltage ($\Delta V$) $10V$ to $100V$, is $Q_2(V_1-V_0) = 1C (100V-10V)$, where Voltage, $V$, represent the _energy_ potential — analogous to, drumroll please, $\frac{J}{kg}$, except this time its $\frac{J}{C}$.

\definition[Where $Q_2$ is the the charge in Coulombs $C$ of the test charge, and $V_1$ and $V_0$ are the electric potential values of the points the charge is being moved to and from]{Electric Potential Energy}{$Q_2(V_1-V_0)$}
