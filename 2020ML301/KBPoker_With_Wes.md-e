Though a man was cheating, got data sets from all the other players, was able to use ml to graph standard deviation of winning vs value of starting of hands.

Cheater had backdoor and could see other hands, had a standard dev of 8, compared to the normal 2. *They were able to catch him with analysis of big data.*
