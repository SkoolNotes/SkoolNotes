# Validation

We have visualized out models and used human judgment to, well, judge them. We have *not* done this algorithmically or mathematically. 


## Why?

Some things are blind to the human eye. Eg. underfitting and overfitting. 

Not enough data, the algorythym was buggy (can't we see these though? maybe just not as easily?)
