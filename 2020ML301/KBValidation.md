# Validation

We have visualized out models and used human judgment to, well, judge them. We have *not* done this algorithmically or mathematically. 


## Why?

Some things are blind to the human eye. Eg. underfitting and overfitting. 

Not enough data, the algorithm was buggy (can't we see these though? maybe just not as easily?)

### Underfitting

Wrong algorithm, buggy, or the data just sucks / there isn't actually a correlation. 


### Overfitting

Traing *to well* to our dataset, making it not applicable to the real world.
