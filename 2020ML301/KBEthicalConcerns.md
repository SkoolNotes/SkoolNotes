- Privacy
	- Good ml requires lots of data, so inherent leads to violation
	- Also, algorythym predicts private things?
		- Target example. 
		
- Bias 
	- > Our model has bias built into them 
		- ex. prop 25
			- get rid of bail, and use ml to identify flight risks
			- has bias in the model due to a biased dataset
	- Input bias -> output bias 
	
- Abuse and misuse 
	- Using ml in ways that are morally wrong 
		- Ex. Cambridge analytica
			- Put up quizes, then sold data to companys which put targeted adds to swing votes. 

- Model explanability
	- Don't know how to explain results
	
- Responsibility
	- Sold model to someone who used it for abusive use / it just breaks 
		- Who is at fault? 
			- Model builder? Data collector? Abuser? 
		- Large problem for things that are "literally life or death" 
			- Watson, what happens when it's wrong?
			
- Automation of labor
