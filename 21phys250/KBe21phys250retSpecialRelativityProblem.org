#+TITLE: Linear Escape

To test his prized cows' intelligence, Farmer John has trapped Bessie and Elsie in an escape room!

The escape room is a long tunnel in which the cows are traveling--Bessie at -0.4c and Elsie at 0.6c. Bessie is hoof-cuffed and cannot solve any puzzles, but she is given the instructions on how to get out. In order to transmit this information to Elsie, she has to turn on a light so Elsie sees it five seconds after the challenge begins.
