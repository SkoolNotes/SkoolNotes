#+TITLE: Notes on The Quantum World by Kenneth W Ford
* beneath the surface of things
** scale
*** wood seems solid, but is mostly empty space (atoms). Quantum effects are noticable on even smaller scales
	Atoms are like Propeller analogy: easy for something small and fast to get through, but hard for something large and slow.
** unintuitive
   Small (quantum mechanics) and fast (special relativity) things behave unintuitively
** particle history
*** electron and proton
	known to exist in 1926
*** photon
	no mass, created/detsroyed easily, was thought of as a funky 'almost particle' until it was discovered that they behave similarly to electrons and that electrons can be created/destroyed easily too
** fundamental discoveries in 1924-1928
*** matter has wave properties
*** fundamental laws are probabliistic
*** heisenburg uncertainty
*** discrete electron spin
*** every particle has an antiparticle
*** multiple momentums simultaneously
*** no two electrons can be in the same state of motion at the same time?
** unlike classical mechanics, properties and actions are not as distinct in the quantum world
** quantum mechanics won't follow common sense, which is to be expected because common sense is based on much larger things
** subatomic vs fundamental particles
*** hundreds of subatomic particles, but only a few are fundamental
*** most are composite
*** just like how there are hundreds of atoms but they are all composed of electrons, protons, neutrons
*** there are 24 fundamental particles excluding the higgs boson, graviton (which is not yet proven), and antiparticles.
* how small is small? How fast is fast? (scale)
** convienent units
*** femtometer (fm, $10^{-15} m$)
**** roughly a proton diameter
**** 6 miles is geometrically centered between the smallest particle probe and the radius of the known universe.
**** smallest prob is $10^{-18}$ meters. The plank length is $10^{-35}$ meters
*** speed of light (c, $3 \times 10^8 m/s^2$)
**** not as sped as distances are small
**** atoms and molecules vibrate roughly $10^{-5} c$ or $10^{-6} c$
**** the lighter something is, the faster it can go, so its likely that the rest-massless photon is the fastest
**** some theoretical tachyon business which can maybe go faster
*** time
**** humans
***** image flashed for a hundreth of a second (10 ms) can be precieved but not a thousandth
***** average human reaction time is 150-300ms
**** time to cross diameter of a proton at sped of light = $10^{-23}s$
**** particles that live long enough to leave trails in the detector live roughly $10^{-10}$ to $10^{-6}$
**** longest living is proton for 15 min (10^3)
*** mass
**** mass is inertia, measured by how hard it is to accelerate them (change their motion)
**** often measured as energy via $E = mc^2$
***** proton = 938MeV is easier to say than $1.67\times 10^{-27}kg$
*** electron volt (eV, energy auired by an electron being accelerated through an electric potential of 1 volt)
**** roughly a photon of red light
**** particle accelerators are made to create high energy particles that can then be converted to mass
**** modern accelerators go to roughly 1TeV, while protons move with only 1eV on the surface of the sun and weigh almost 1GeV.
*** charge ($e, 1.6\times 10^{-19}C$)
**** protons and electrons have the same magnitude of charge, deemed one unit. quarks have fractional charges
**** open questions
***** why is charge quantized/descrete
***** what happens near charged particles? inf charge as dist \to zero
***** if particles are physically sized, why dont parts of the particle repel itself
*** spin
**** two types: spin and orbital motion
**** measured with angular momentum
**** fundamental particles don't have a descernible spin but do have an angular momentum
**** $\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} = 1.05\times 10^{-34} kgm^2/s$
**** orbital angular momentum must be a multiple of $\hbar$ and spin angular momentum can be a multiple of $\frac{1}{2}\hbar$?
**** a particle type can have many spins, but the change in spin is often so drastic that they are considered two different particles
*** fundamental constants
**** most units are chosen arbitrarily based on earths size or something, but there are two fundamental ones
**** plank's constant $h$ defines the quantum scale... larger $h$ would make the universe 'lumpier' or 'more pixelated'
**** the speed of light $c$ is the fastest speed, or something.
**** there is expceted to be a third constant to form a complete basis, but we haven't found one yet
***** it would be a length or a time
* meet the leptons
** types (flavor) electron, muon, tau
** conserve {charge, flavor, energy, momentum}
** neutrinos are like the soul of its particle - tiny mass but same flavor
** they have multiples of half unit spins or something
** any particles can be created as long as everything is conserved
* the rest of the extended family
** quarks
*** six of them in groups of three
*** they group up in the wild to make up other composite particles
*** particles have integer charge, but quarks come in one-third multiples of charge
*** baryon number
**** another type of 'charge' that is also conserved
**** protons and neutrons are both baryonic (meaning they have baryon number?)
**** like leptons, the lightest baryon cannot decay because there is nothing to decay into (the proton)
**** quarks have one-third baryon number also
*** antiquarks
**** makes up meson with another singular quark (For a total baryon number of 0)
**** antiquark particles are unstable
*** color
**** red, green, blue, antired, antigreen, antiblue
**** all three or a normal with an anti is colorless..???

** composite particles
*** baryons vs mesons
**** baryons have half odd integral spins (1/2, 3/2, 5/2) while mesons have integral spins
**** baryons are made of 3 quarks each while mesons are made up of a quark and an antiquark
**** baryons are fermions and mesons are bosons. all are hadrons (strongly interacting) bc quarks are strongly interacting
**** mesons have baryon number zero
*** some baryons
**** lightest are proton and neutron (made up up and down quarks)
**** then heavier ones have strange quarks, and some even heavier have charm and bottom quarks
**** have not found a baryon that contains a top quark yet
**** other than the proton, all 'baryons are unstable (radoactive)'
**** they all live a really short time (see the table) roughly $10^{-10}$ to $10^{-19}$ seconds
*** some mesons

**** the pion (lightest meson)
***** Yukawa thought pions moving around gave rise to the strong nuclear force, but now we think its quarks exchanging gluons
***** there is a charged version of the pion which is made of a down quark and an anti-up quark (written \(d\bar u\))
