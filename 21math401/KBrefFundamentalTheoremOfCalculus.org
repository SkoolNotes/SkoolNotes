#+TITLE: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
* loose definition
  \[\begin{aligned}
  \int \frac{d}{dx}f(x) dx = f(x)
  \end{aligned}\]
* formal definition
  The theorem comes in two parts, apparently
** part 1
   #+begin_quote
   If $f(x)$ is continuous over an interval $[a, b]$, and the function $F(x)$ is defined by
   \[\begin{aligned}
   F(x) = \int_{a}^{x} f(t) dt
   \end{aligned}\]
   then $F'(x) = f(x)$ over $[a, b]$.
   #+end_quote
*** intuition
	Note that its $\int_{a}^{x} f(t) dt$ because $x$ is an argument to the function and $t$ is just the iteration variable.

	Note that the integral can start anywhere to the left (arbitrary $a$) because that is removed as a constant when taking the derivative
*** results
* an example
  Imagine a function that has the bound of an integral as an argument:
  \[\begin{aligned}
  g(x) = \int_0^x t\ dt = \frac{x^2}{2}\\
  \frac{d}{dx}g(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\int_0^x t\ dt = \frac{d}{dx}\frac{x^2}{2} = x
  \end{aligned}\]
