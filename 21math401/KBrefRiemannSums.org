#+TITLE: Riemann Sums
* Slicing into Rectangles
  The general idea of Riemann sums is to slice a curve into vertical non-overlapping rectangles to approximate the area between the curve and the x-axis. This can be expressed mathematically as a summation given the function $f(x)$, the range $[a, b]$, and the number of rectangles $n$:

  \[\begin{aligned}
  \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{b-a}{n} f(a + k\frac{b-a}{n})
  \end{aligned}\]

  This can be written more concisely by defining $\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}$ and $x_i = a + k \Delta x$
