#+TITLE: Revolving Shapes
* an example: semicircle revolved around the x-axis to create a sphere
  We can make cuts perpendicular to the axis of rotation. In this case, you end up with a bunch of circular disks, where the height of each slice is your semicircle function.

  Thus, the volume of the disk is
  \[\begin{aligned}
   \pi f^2(x_i) \Delta x = (a^2-x^2) \pi \Delta x
  \end{aligned}\]

  This is kinda like a Riemann Sum, but with more stuff added on. We can take the limit of the sum

  \[\begin{aligned}
   \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \pi (a^2 - x_i^2) \Delta x
  \end{aligned}\]

  Where $\Delta x = \frac{1}{n}$ and $x_i = -a + \frac{2ak}{n}$

  Expressed as an integral:

  \[\begin{aligned}
   \int_{-a}^{a} \pi (a^2-x^2) dx &\to  \int \pi a^2 dx - \int \pi x^2 dx \\
   &= \pi a^2 x - \pi \frac{1}{3}x^3\\
   &\to \pi a^3 - \pi \frac{1}{3} a^3 + \pi a^3 + \pi \frac{1}{3} (-a)^3\\
   &= 2\pi a^3 - \pi \frac{2}{3} a^3\\
   &= \frac{4}{3} \pi a^3
  \end{aligned}\]
* now lets try a cone

  Rotate
  \[\begin{aligned}
  y = -ax +b
  \end{aligned}\]
  Around the y-axis. Then, each circle (which is layed out flat) has thickness $dy$ and radius $x$ or $\frac{y-b}{-a}$

  The volume of the disk is then
  \[\begin{aligned}
  \pi  \left(\frac{y-b}{-a}\right)  ^2 dy
  \end{aligned}\]

  And we can take the integral of that from $0$ to $b$

  \[\begin{aligned}
   \int_{0}^{b} \pi  \left(\frac{y-b}{-a}\right)  ^2 dy
  \end{aligned}\]
