#+TITLE: Final Project B: Volume of a Solid with Known Cross Section

I chose to use Reigon B (bounded by x=0, y=sqrt(x), and x=9) and the semicircle as my cross section. The integral to calculate the volume is \color{NavyBlue}the integral of \color{OliveGreen}the area of \color{Melon}each slice\color{Black}.

\[\begin{aligned}
 &\textcolor{NavyBlue}{\int_{0}^{9}} \textcolor{OliveGreen}{\pi} \textcolor{Melon}{r_x} \textcolor{OliveGreen}{^2} \textcolor{NavyBlue}{dx}\\
 =&\textcolor{NavyBlue}{\int_{0}^{9}} \textcolor{OliveGreen}{\pi}  \textcolor{Melon}{\left(\frac{\sqrt{x}}{2}\right)}\textcolor{OliveGreen}{^2} \textcolor{NavyBlue}{dx}\\
 =& \frac{\pi}{4}  \int_{0}^{9} x dx\\
 =& \frac{\pi}{8} 9^2\\
 =& \boxed{\frac{81\pi}{8}}\\
\end{aligned}\]

This value is corroborated to four decimal points using the slice generator. The final model can be \color{Blue}[[https://github.com/SkoolNotes/Taproot/blob/main/21math401/KBe21math401retCrossSectionSolidFinalB.scad][downloaded]] \color{Black} and viewed in \color{Blue}[[https://openscad.org/downloads.html][OpenSCAD]] \color{Black} or seen here:
