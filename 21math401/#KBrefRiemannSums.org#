#+TITLE: Riemann Sums
* Slicing into Rectangles
  The general idea of Riemann sums is to slice a curve into vertical non-overlapping rectangles to approximate the area between the curve and the x-axis. This can be expressed mathematically as a summation given the function $f(x)$, the range $[a, b]$, and the number of rectangles $n$:

  \[\begin{aligned}
  \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{b-a}{n} f(a + k\frac{b-a}{n})
  \end{aligned}\]

  This can be written more concisely by defining $\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}$ and $x_i = a + k \Delta x$:

  \[\begin{aligned}
  \sum_{k=1}^{n} \Delta x f(x_i)
  \end{aligned}\]

  These estimates all have the right endpoint of the rectangle touching the curve. You could also use the left endpoint, or use the minimum value one and add a triangle to form a trapezoid.

* Area Interpretation
  Areas under curves can be estimated if you recognize the function. For example:
  \[\begin{aligned}
  \int_{0}^{1} \sqrt{1-x^2} dx
  \end{aligned}\]
  Traces out a quarter of a semicircle, so the area under this curve is $\frac{\pi}{4}$

* Upper and Lower Bound
  To get an upper and lower bound approximation using a Riemann sum, you cannot always take the left or right 
* the Definite Integral
