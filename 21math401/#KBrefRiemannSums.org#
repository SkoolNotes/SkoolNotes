#+TITLE: Riemann Sums
* Slicing into Rectangles
  The general idea of Riemann sums is to slice a curve into vertical non-overlapping rectangles to approximate the area between the curve and the x-axis. This can be expressed mathematically as a summation given the function $f(x)$:
  
  \[\begin{aligned}
  \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{n} 
  \end{aligned}\]

* Upper and Lower Bound
* the Definite Integral
