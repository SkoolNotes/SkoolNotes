# an example: semicircle revolved around the x-axis to create a sphere

We can make cuts perpendicular to the axis of rotation. In this case,
you end up with a bunch of circular disks, where the height of each
slice is your semicircle function.

Thus, the volume of the disk is $$\begin{aligned}
   \pi f^2(x_i) \Delta x = (a^2-x^2) \pi \Delta x
  \end{aligned}$$

This is kinda like a Riemann Sum.
