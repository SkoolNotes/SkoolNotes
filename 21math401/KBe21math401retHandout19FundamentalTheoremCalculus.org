* Let $F(x) = \int_{0}^{x} f(t) dt$
** complete the table
   | x    |   0 |             1 |             2 |             3 |   4 |
   | F(x) | $0$ | $\frac{4}{3}$ | $\frac{8}{3}$ | $\frac{4}{3}$ | $0$ |

* $G(x) = \int_{2}^{x} f(t) dt$

** complete the table
   | x    |              0 |              1 |   2 |              3 |              4 |
   | G(x) | $-\frac{8}{3}$ | $-\frac{4}{3}$ | $0$ | -$\frac{4}{3}$ | $-\frac{8}{3}$ |

* 3

** complete the table
   | x    |   0 |             1 |             2 |             3 |   4 |
   | H(x) | $0$ | $\frac{4}{3}$ | $\frac{8}{3}$ | $\frac{4}{3}$ | $0$ |

** sketch the function
   same as 1b

* complete the table
  |           | $F(x)$     | $G(x)$ | $H(x)$ |
  | maximum   | 4x+2       |        |        |
  | minimum   | 4x         |        |        |
  | increases | [4x, 4x+2] |        |        |
  | decreases | [4x-2, 4x] |        |        |
  The other columns are the same, because $H(x) = F(x)$ and $G(x) = H(x)-\frac{8}{3}$.

* why does it work over the entire domain?
  The argument for each cell is the same: it should work across the domain because those are the points where the derivative of $F(x)$ (which is $f(x)$) is zero and function is periodic.

  $F(x)$ increases when $f(x)$ is positive.

* family of functions
  Changing the 'zero point' of the derivative just shifts the graph up and down, by up to the range of the function.

* sketching more functions

** $F_1(x) = \int_{x}^{0} f(t) dt$
   $F(x)$ but reflected across the x-axis (negated)

** $F_2(x) = \int_{0}^{x} f(-t) dt$
   $f$ is an odd function so $f(-t) = -f(t)$ so $F_2 = F_1$

** $F_3(x) = \int_{0}^{2x} f(t) dt$
   $F_3(x) = F(2x)$ which is a parent function transformation which compresses the graph along the x-axis.

** $F_4(x) = \int_{0}^{x} f(|t|) dt$
   For $x \ge 0$, $F_4(x) = F(x)$. However, for $x < 0$, the function will be the negative of the $x\geq0 $ case because the integral is from right to left.

** $F_5(x) = \int_{0}^{x} |f(t)| dt$
   Instead of being a periodic function, this function will be even (all the decreasing parts of $F(x)$ become increasing with the same shape)
