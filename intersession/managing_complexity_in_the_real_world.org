#+TITLE: flo--managing complexity in the real world
* his intro / background
** used to be very into econ
** worked at world bank bc he thought it was a good place to meet people who were interested in math and econ and help the world
** was sent to a country (forgot) during communism->capitalism transition and saw that the forced capitalist policies were not working
** went into management because that allowed him to actually help
** sante fe institute
*** centeripece for a global movement to involve complexity in sciences accross disciplines
*** from los alamos national labs
*** 'universal relationships'
*** lots of nobel prizes
*** applications of graph theory and network theory, and lots of econ
**** understanding when societies are going to have a revolution, finiance, energy grid
* other related areas
** do individuals matter in history
** impacts on marketing based on faith studies?
* Overview
** this intersession is "interdisciplinary fixing of economics"
* Warmup
** insectivora, macroscelidea avg mass vs avg BMR, guess avg bmr for pholidota given avg mass
*** I just took the ratios and took a high and low
*** a few strategies for solving the problem
**** look for a common ratio (assume 0 mass = 0 BMR)
**** fit a line
**** it's actually not a linear relation, and the answer is relatively unexpected (much lower ratio)
** the monkey business illusion (ball passing -> miss other stuff)
*** when you get attached to a tool, you miss loads of other things
* universality
** examples
*** common limit theorem
**** lots of common processes produce gauseian distributions
***** thus, there is a "universality" in the normal distribution
*** other theorem? (something with gauss)
**** if things are often normal distributions, then statistics kind of works (because that's what it's all based on)
*** all mamals average the same number of heartbeats
**** small animals have fast hearts and die sooner, vice versa
*** metabolic rate (first warm up problem)
**** log log linear -> constant rate of savings?
**** constant increase in efficiency
**** roughly 3/4 or 2/3 exponent
**** exponent can be derived by networks (circulatory system)
* complexity
** core
*** taking a general tool and applying it elsewhere
** methodology
*** start with a data rich domain and find the generative mechinism, then apply to the data sparse
