* what do those grand theories do?
** describe invariant relationships like E=mc^2
** define limits on what is possible and what isn't
** emergent properties from computational systems that are difficult to predict
* how does computing let us do similar things to laws and theories in science?
* computational complexity theory
** how long it takes to compute the answer as a function of the input size
** overview of presentation
*** methods for determining computational complexity
*** wide variation in complexity of diff problems
*** computationally hard problems are very difficult
*** some problems have not yet been proven
*** problems have been grouped into equivalence classes
* big O notation
** approximate run time (not exact)
** how the time scales/changes
* examples
