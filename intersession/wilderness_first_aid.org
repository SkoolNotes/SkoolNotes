* diff between normal first aid and wilderness first aid
** when you are 2 hours away from a hospital
*** either far or will tike a while to get there
* requires
** improv
** thinking on the fly
** treating without 100% diagnosis
** think about what body systems are being impacted
* body systems
** respiratory system
*** nose, mouth, airway, lungs, diaphragm
*** things that could go wrong
**** liquid in the lungs
**** puncture to the lungs (rib or external)
**** choking on something or anything that blocks your airway
**** allergies and asthma - anaphalaxis
** cardiovascular system
*** heart, vessels
*** things that could go wrong
**** bleeding
***** some blood vessels are important (corodal, femeral arteries)
**** heart damage
**** blood clot / swelling
**** infection
** musculoskeletal system
*** things that could go wrong
**** sprain, strain, twisted ankle, jammed finger
**** break
** these other ones aren't going to be focusod on as much
*** integumetntary system
*** nervous system
*** digestive system
*** urinary system
*** reproductive system
*** endocrine system
*** lymphatic/immune system
* patient assessment
** scene saftey and sizeup
*** is this a safe situation for you to go into?
*** if you get hurt or sick, then you become a second patient
*** unsafe things like
**** a rock falling, bees, a clif, etc
*** personal protective equipment
**** gloves? goggles?
** ABCs (to address urgent issues)
*** Airway
**** problems
***** obstructed?
***** damage to the lungs?
**** ways to see (bad)
***** choking
***** coughing
***** wheezing
***** swelling
**** ways to see (good)
***** speaking / screaming (their airway is clear)
***** chest rise / fall (esp if laying down)
***** *pay attention to if this stops happening*
**** resolve it
***** heimlich maneuver (IF THEY ARE NOT COUGHING)
***** if coughing, KEEP COUGHING, pat on back
*** Breathing
**** problems
***** quality of breath (hyperventilation bad)
***** a tightening sound may indicate constriction of airway
**** ways to deal
***** for allergies / asthma - epipen/inhaler
****** they should administer it themselves if able
****** tripod position - lean them forwards or sitting up
****** a bag valve mask
*** Circulation
**** problems
***** puncture wounds or losing blood
**** look for
***** pulse
****** close pulses will be stronger, so a strong radial (wrist) pulse is good
**** ways to deal
***** IF HEART NOT BEATING (no pulse) cpr - chest compressions
***** major bleed
****** direct, well aimed pressure
****** stuff the wound
****** turniquet
******* you won't really come across a situation where this is the best option
******* only happens in a severed or nearly severed limb (if its dangling/detatched)
******* the patient will lose a limb
*** Is there anything that will be a threat in five minutes?
* this vs that?
** break vs muscle strain
*** is it stable or not? can you walk on it / can you get yourself out?
** a closed break is not so bad but an open break is very bad
