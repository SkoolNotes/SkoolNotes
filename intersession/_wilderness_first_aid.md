# diff between normal first aid and wilderness first aid

## when you are 2 hours away from a hospital

### either far or will tike a while to get there

# requires

## improv

## thinking on the fly

## treating without 100% diagnosis

## think about what body systems are being impacted

# body systems

## respiratory system

### nose, mouth, airway, lungs, diaphragm

### things that could go wrong

1.  liquid in the lungs

2.  puncture to the lungs (rib or external)

3.  choking on something or anything that blocks your airway

4.  allergies and asthma - anaphalaxis

## cardiovascular system

### heart, vessels

### things that could go wrong

1.  bleeding

    1.  some blood vessels are important (corodal, femeral arteries)

2.  heart damage

3.  blood clot / swelling

4.  infection

## musculoskeletal system

### things that could go wrong

1.  sprain, strain, twisted ankle, jammed finger

2.  break

## these other ones aren\'t going to be focusod on as much

### integumetntary system

### nervous system

### digestive system

### urinary system

### reproductive system

### endocrine system

### lymphatic/immune system

# patient assessment

## scene saftey and sizeup

### is this a safe situation for you to go into?

### if you get hurt or sick, then you become a second patient

### unsafe things like

1.  a rock falling, bees, a clif, etc

### personal protective equipment

1.  gloves? goggles?

## ABCs (to address urgent issues)

### Airway

1.  problems

    1.  obstructed?

    2.  damage to the lungs?

2.  ways to see (bad)

    1.  choking

    2.  coughing

    3.  wheezing

    4.  swelling

3.  ways to see (good)

    1.  speaking / screaming (their airway is clear)

    2.  chest rise / fall (esp if laying down)

    3.  **pay attention to if this stops happening**

4.  resolve it

    1.  heimlich maneuver (IF THEY ARE NOT COUGHING)

    2.  if coughing, KEEP COUGHING, pat on back

### Breathing

1.  problems

    1.  quality of breath (hyperventilation bad)

    2.  a tightening sound may indicate constriction of airway

2.  ways to deal

    1.  for allergies / asthma - epipen/inhaler

        1.  they should administer it themselves if able

        2.  tripod position - lean them forwards or sitting up

        3.  a bag valve mask

### Circulation

1.  problems

    1.  puncture wounds or losing blood

2.  look for

    1.  pulse

        1.  close pulses will be stronger, so a strong radial (wrist)
            pulse is good

3.  ways to deal

    1.  IF HEART NOT BEATING (no pulse) cpr - chest compressions

    2.  major bleed

        1.  direct, well aimed pressure

        2.  presssure dressing

            1.  pack gauze on wound then wrap as tight as possible
                WITHOUT cutting off bloodflow

        3.  stuff the wound

        4.  turniquet

            1.  you won\'t really come across a situation where this is
                the best option

            2.  only happens in a severed or nearly severed limb (if its
                dangling/detatched)

            3.  the patient will lose a limb

### Is there anything that will be a threat in five minutes?

## figuring out what is going on

### overview

1.  \'make a diagnosis\' or as close to one as possible

### history/SAMPLE

1.  ask questions

    1.  what happened?

    2.  are you sick? did you eat something?

    3.  get the story of the day

### head to toe

1.  overview

    1.  look and listen to see what\'s going on

### vital signs

1.  overview

    1.  cues about how the body is doing

2.  is

    1.  heart rate

        1.  typcally 60-100 for resting

        2.  might be up if they are hurt or panicked

    2.  respratory rate

    3.  blood pressure (unlikely to have the equipment)

    4.  pupils? bad if

        1.  head injury - maybe diff pupil size

        2.  not responding to light

        3.  really large

    5.  mental state

        1.  how conscious are they

## fix it

### wound

### break/strain

### sickness

### evacuation

# this vs that?

## break vs muscle strain

### is it stable or not? can you walk on it / can you get yourself out?

## a closed break is not so bad but an open break is very bad

# situations

## minor wound / scrape

### proirites

1.  infection

    1.  area may be red, warm, throbbing, smell, leaking puss

    2.  how to clean a wound

        1.  first remove debris (dirt, pebbles) (tebridement)

        2.  flush with clean water (pressure behind water is good)

        3.  disinfectant (alchohol or peroxide)

            1.  dont put alchohol directly on an open wound (may dry it
                out)

            2.  use it around the wound on the skin

            3.  dab with alchohol splashed gauze (dont wipe)

            4.  thin layer for creams and ointments

    3.  bandage it if:

        1.  may get dirty again

        2.  if it might bleed again

        3.  maybe for comfort

        4.  otherwise, open air is better

2.  bleeding control

## ankle/joint assesment

### elevated vitals, swelling, says ankle got stuck between rocks and got twisted

### maybe:break, strain, sprain, roll, etc

1.  break

    1.  bone damage

2.  strain / sprain

    1.  tendon or ligament damage

3.  how to tell the difference

    1.  something in the middle of a limb, it\'s probably a break

    2.  something at a joint, it\'s usually a strain or sprain

    3.  breaks are point tender, strains/sprains are area tender

### ask: can it be moved?

### swollen, area pain, not much movement, from an ankle roll implies sprain

1.  should use a splint (stop the movement, hold tight in a comfortable
    location)

2.  can also use compression (stretchy bandage)

3.  ice pack to help with swelling, or advil

### to get out

1.  is it stable? can she walk?

2.  if not, call for the team with the litter/stretcher (\'call for help
    with evacuation\')

3.  maybe use a sitting litter (put arms around someone and carry them
    out)

## environmental illness (very hot or very cold)

### symptoms

1.  shivering

2.  slurred speach

3.  weird walking / hand fumbles

4.  mumbles, stumbles, fumbles, grumbles

5.  **get out of wet clothing**

6.  layers / blankets

7.  have them move (not sweaty but warm)

8.  warm or maybe sugary drink

## dehydration / hyperthermia

### heat exhaustion

### symptoms

1.  if they feel hot

2.  haven\'t had enough water

3.  not able to regulate heat

4.  dizzy/lightheaded

5.  stumbling or spacey

6.  stop sweating is very bad

### hyponutremia

1.  make sure they eat something (or get electrolytes) while drinking
    water

### heat stroke

1.  rare (deasert with no water for days)

# if you got lost

## it depends

### what happened to get you lost

### don\'t go offtrail, have a compass and map. tell someone where you are going and when you will be back!

### can you backtrack safely, as that will be the best bet

1.  don\'t wander because you may get more lost

### get to higher ground visibly

# shock position

## use for keeping blood in people (if you are worried that they don\'t have enough blood in their system)
