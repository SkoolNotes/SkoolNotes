\begin{enumerate}
\item
  if you use nix codes to do a frequency distribution
\item
  count the number of businesses in the most populous, second most
  populous, etc. then it forms the simon yule distribution, but the
  ordering was different.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    thus, could there be some hidden mechinism that requires a specific
    relative distribution of diversity to grow?
  \end{enumerate}
