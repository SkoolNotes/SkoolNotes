# WWII and the Rise of the Cold War Tensions

## Causes of WWII: a brainstorm
- The failure of the treaty of versailies
- WWI not being as hard and did not destroy the prospects of german nationalism
- The economic downfall caused by the previous war
- The rise of the brutal systems of structure throughout the world â€” i.e. strong alt-right nationalism
- The ruthless desire to peace
- The destroying of present systems of the balance of power by higher-level fighting tools

## How not to get a bonus Hitler
- Weaken individual control
- Operate under the shared assumption of peacekeeping and democracy
- Find shared goals and ideals to operate upon
- Set clear guidelines for treaties and consiquences
- Build up collective force to be able to enforce treties (up and not limited to the threat of nuclear armegetton)

**Under the assumption of global cooperation**
- Weaking individual economic control

**Strategies to prevent**
- Diminished economic freedom
- Co-operation across countries
- GIVE PEOPLE NUKES!!!!!! (mutually assured destruction)

Postwar world's rules

- Constructing economic systems and global market
- "If you depend on a country for trade, you won't nuke them."
- => Really, markets are cultivated. The plants are growing independently, but the gardener is responsible for cultivating the garden and preventing weeds
