# WWII and the Rise of the Cold War Tensions

## Causes of WWII: a brainstorm
- The failure of the treaty of versailies
- WWI not being as hard and did not destroy the prospects of german nationalism
- The economic downfall caused by the previous war
- The rise of the brutal systems of structure throughout the world â€” i.e. strong alt-right nationalism
- The ruthless desire to peace
- The destroying of present systems of the balance of power by higher-level fighting tools

## How not to get a bonus Hitler
- Weaken individual control
- Operate under the shared assumption of peacekeeping and democracy
- Find shared goals and ideals to operate upon
- Set clear guidelines for treaties and consiquences
- Build up collective force to be able to enforce treties (up and not limited to the threat of nuclear armegetton)

**Under the assumption of global cooperation**
- Weaking individual economic control

**Strategies to prevent**
- Diminished economic freedom
- Co-operation across countries
- GIVE PEOPLE NUKES!!!!!! (mutually assured destruction)

Postwar world's rules

- Constructing economic systems and global market
- "If you depend on a country for trade, you won't nuke them."
- => Really, markets are cultivated. The plants are growing independently, but the gardener is responsible for cultivating the garden and preventing weeds


### Kensian Capitalism
- Capitalism is not self-regulating
- Capitalism need an external structure for making it work well

=> In economic downturns, the govrenment should put money in circulation, in upward economy, the economy should start regulating economy

### Neoliberalistic Capitalism
- Capitalism is self-correcting
- Inflation is the thing you should fear

=> Goverments will worsen inflation, which is the boogieman, so capitalism needs guardrails against inflation, but generally they will self-correct and so leave them to self-correct


## Global Market: Bretton Woods Agreement

**United Nations**: facilatete diplomatic exchange

IMF = create and loan out short-term trade deficits and regulate exchanges

World Bank = roll infrastructure loans to countries for the long economic development

To standardize, everything is pegged against the dollar, which is pegged against $36/oz.

This post-war order allows effective stability and balance


***

If you have two powers, they almost always result in some form of conflict.

"The attitutes around the constrsuction of the post-war world lead to the need for a global hegemone that ensures stability." And, at that moment, the United States is the target to achieve that hegemony.
