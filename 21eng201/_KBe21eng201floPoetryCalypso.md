title: Calypso Poem by Kamau Braithwaite
---

# listening

## many lines follow the calypso pattern

## but some clash

## 2 and 3 specifically clash

# silent reading

## some of the later stanzas really do fall apart, both rhyme scheme and structure

## pattern of fast and slow sections

## seems to loose structure the way the island life collapsed

# reading + calypso music
