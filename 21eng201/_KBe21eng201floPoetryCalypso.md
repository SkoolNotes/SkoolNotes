title: Calypso Poem by Kamau Braithwaite
---

# listening

## many lines follow the calypso pattern

## but some clash

## 2 and 3 specifically clash

# silent reading

## some of the later stanzas really do fall apart, both rhyme scheme and structure

## pattern of fast and slow sections

## seems to loose structure the way the island life collapsed

# reading + calypso music

## most lines go together with the music, but some lines are far shorter / should be combined

## don\'t clash as much as I expected, the music gives the poem structure
