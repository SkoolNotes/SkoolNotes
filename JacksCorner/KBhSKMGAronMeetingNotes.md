# Alexa's Notes
Alexa...

- Splitting a school year into three equal parts
- One spring proposal 
	- Trimester simple is **BEING PROPOSED**
	- Only blocks 1-4 meet in the first part 
	- Blocks 5-8 meet in the second part

# Aron Meeting Notes
- Students are taking 8 courses
- Students that are in full-year courses could finish courses => but that's hard
- Numerical Limits: 18/section. ~1/2 of the student body max; 
- WE KNOW
	- A semester model , but we can't do cohorting
	- A trimester model => a little difficult,  but _how do we do cohorting_
	- Considering models with semester-long classes

Reason for shifting needs is because human build time. 

- Grade Cohorting
- Complex Trimester => crates a lot of open spaces in the day
- Simple Trimester
