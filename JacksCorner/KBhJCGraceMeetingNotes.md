# Grace's Meeting Notes
- Interested in memory
- Synapses are influencing each other => allows cluster processing => provide more insight
- Understanding brains+memory is key to understanding human behavior => excited about the mechanisms of the brain
-  Memory is interesting b/c its complex and we don't know about => personal and culture narratives are critical

***

- Like to talk about the causal pathways found
	- Figs 1, 8, 3
	- Personally want to focus on the background, observation, and pathways
	- General structure of presentation: Figures 1,8,3 between the structure of {Big pic, {hypo, result, pathway}, implication}

* Scientific story â€” what we talk about last time: the story of the LTP induced intra-synaptic PAP outflow cross talk
