* Paper "trying to be inconclusive" because they don't want to be wrong
* Not very conclusive
	* Venus less studied
	* Recommended space YouTube videos from brother
	* Then, YouTube's algo recommended the paper to him
* "Grandmother was _NOT!_ abduced by aliens" => but! interest in Fermi's paradox
	* Fermi's paradox videos got sent from brother 
	
Suggestion: lead in with Fermi's paradox?
