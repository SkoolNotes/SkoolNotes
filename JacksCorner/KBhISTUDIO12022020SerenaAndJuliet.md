# iStudio Check-Ins, Juliet and Serena

=> **Kyntic**

Juliet: doing more of the hardware — having a sensor that the data could go onto. Need headway into software

Serena: researching and branding — putting together about a brunch of users and start prototyping. Want to figure out where devices are going to be + get UX. 

GOAL: focus on software

Need to start collecting data to go from there.

**Next step: get data for the trouletts tics**
