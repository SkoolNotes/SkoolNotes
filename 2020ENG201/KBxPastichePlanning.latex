Assignment guidelines

After reading and analyzing Kincaid’s book, you have a better understanding of rhetorical purpose and techniques. Using Kincaid as inspiration, and using at least three of her techniques (parentheses, tone, anaphora, personal pronouns, labyrinthine sentence, em-dashes, etc.), write a rhetorical pastiche on one of the prompts below. 

In addition to your pastiche, please provide a short reflection. You should explain your rhetorical purpose as well as the techniques and elements of style you are trying to imitate (this means you will need to reflect a bit on Kincaid’s techniques, so that you can explain what aspects of her writing you’ve been inspired by). Your reflection is a chance to explain what you want to accomplish, in case it doesn’t fully come through in your piece, as well as to demonstrate your understanding of rhetorical techniques.

Prompts

Conflicts in identity and place: In A Small Place Kincaid describes a conflicted relationship with identity, place, and the past, at times nostalgic, at times combative. Write about some aspect of your life—a part of your identity, a favorite place, your spoken/written languages, a relationship—that evokes contradiction and conflict for you. You may employ an implicit argument in your essay (like Kincaid’s), but you *must* have an explicit argument to articulate in your reflection. 
 
Responsible travel: Kincaid begins her text with a mockery of “you,” an assumed pasty-faced (read: white), European tourist visiting Antigua. Reflect on your position as a sometimes-tourist, privileged at least to some extent. Possible intended audiences include American friends and family unaware of the complicated power dynamics of traveling in non-Western and/or post-colonial countries, or the “locals” of said country: Antiguans, Peruvians, Costa Ricans, or others.
 
3. Solutions for issues based in poverty: Critiques of philanthropy often suggest it is motivated by a colonial mindset (“white savior complex,” “white volunteerism”). Yet the fact remains that poverty proliferates and many aid organizations work to alleviate illness, destitution, and inequity. Use the Poverty Action Lab site (https://www.povertyactionlab.org/ (Links to an external site.)) to suggest a solution for some *manageable* issue based in poverty. Note about navigating the site: You may find it useful to start using either “Regions” or “Sectors”; “evaluations” and “publications” motivate issues and provide solutions (policy proposals).

\subsection{Righting Thyme.}\label{righting-thyme.}}

Imagine you lived in America. Where the sun always shines (except when
it doesn't, but that doesn't matter), where the rain is always
refreshing, and where all dreams can come true. You look around and see
America, the land of dreams! --- Of freedom, of innovation, of equality,
ect. You notice the air is filled with hope (it's almost sickly sweet,
or maybe just sickly), and the eyes are filled with phones. You move on,
not thinking to much about it, because how could some phones ruin
(shatter your conception of) the magnificent, great, elitist land of
America? The land of success, where all the tech giants reside ---
Apple, Amazon, Google --- and you reside here to! You can't pass that up
for anything if you want to be successful like them. You watch the
entertainment --- the entertainment here is great! you think to
yourself; the entertainment is reality. Or maybe it isn't. Doesn't
matter. You talk with others in your gated bubble of a community
(inescapable) about the latest crazy thing that someone, somethem, did,
all the while patting yourself on the back for being an intellectual,
for being an informed citizen, for exercising your rights in this
wonderful functioning (functioning?) democracy (not disagreeing, of
course --- that would be horrendous --- only affirming beliefs here. But
are they beliefs?). You become united, defined, under your shared
``beliefs'' with those in your bubble, (which you give a name, because
the beliefs themselves are irrelevant), then find connection, maybe
tribal connection, but connection nonetheless in being a part of
whichever name you have given your belief system, but it's all okay (of
course), because you are having conversations, you are reading the news,
you aren't like those them people with their lies and false beliefs,
their stubbornness and misinformation. You watch the news all day, all
night, because you have to be an informed citizen, (popcorn out of frame
in virtuous social media post), constantly being warned of fake news, of
the fake news, of the them news. How do you find this news? Oh, well,
that's simple: does it fall under your idealogy? Yes? Great. Send it
your friends (with an inspirational message). Does it not? Great. Send
it to your friends (with a laughing emoji or deep, sad message about the
state of this country / the news / the society / your mental state/
