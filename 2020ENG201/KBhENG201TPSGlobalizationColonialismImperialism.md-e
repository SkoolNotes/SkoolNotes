    * Trying to "Fix" the other cultures — colonialism
    * Trying to strengthen your own — imperialism
2) What is globalization?
    * The process of the world being more inter-connection
3) How might globalization compare with imperialism?
    * Rejection — imperialists will reject globalization because of the desire not to collaborate/compromise

**Imperialism => Globalization**
