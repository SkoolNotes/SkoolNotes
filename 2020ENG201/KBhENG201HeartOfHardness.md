[Alexa and Nueva folks, the Slides.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a9mxL5Pot8sbcIYP1mLiFqhQrYEOa60eIyHp3ftTLGo)

Ok. Now that that's out of the way, let's deal with this "Bloody Racist" book. To understand this work fully, one must understand Congo, its govermental systems, and the Scramble for Africa (Africa's cakeification by Europeans).

## Critical Theory
An approach to contentualize a text + see through to something. Think: "a feminist lens" — Critical Race Theory, Queer Theory, Maxist Theory, Feminist Theory, Post-Colonial Theory, Colonial Theory, Cultral Studies, etc. etc.

And, here's the rub: **History is Written by the Victors** — an important part of the analysis of the _Heart of Darkness_ is to recognize its story in a Colonial Lens.

[The Various Lit Theories](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/writing_in_literature/literary_theory_and_schools_of_criticism/)

## Reflections
[[KBhENG201Page0t17]]

## Why are we reading it?
For answers to the essential question, of course! [[KBhENG201AlexaD1]]

* How do literature, language, and storytelling both perpetuate and dismantle the tools of the colonizer?  
    * Could be a text that attempts to dismatle racism => "loot at the damage that Europeans did"
    * Could be a text that attempts to propergate racism 
* How does colonialism shift notions of race, equity, socio-economic status, natural resources, religion for the colonizer, colonized, and the reader?
