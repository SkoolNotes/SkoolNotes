Please take your listening log from mid-semester conferences and re-read your reflection for this course. Copy and paste it into the web-based eval and write 150-250 words in response to that about your continued areas of strength and your progress towards your goals.

If students did not write a reflection and/or did not set a goal for their listening log, they were asked to respond to the following questions: 
```

- What did you learn about writing this semester? How have you grown as a writer?
	- Iv'e gained a lot of tacit knowledge about writing
- Describe your writing process and how it has evolved over the semester?
- Describe the progress youâ€™ve made in your ability to understand a text, to identify important moments, to annotate them, and to create good questions to bring to class?
- What aspect of your performance in English class are you most proud about this semester (writing process, discussion skills, close reading, a specific assignment)?
- What are your goals in English for next semester? Set at least two specific goals and describe how you will meet them.
