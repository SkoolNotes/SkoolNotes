Please take your listening log from mid-semester conferences and re-read your reflection for this course. Copy and paste it into the web-based eval and write 150-250 words in response to that about your continued areas of strength and your progress towards your goals.

If students did not write a reflection and/or did not set a goal for their listening log, they were asked to respond to the following questions: 
```

- What did you learn about writing this semester? How have you grown as a writer?
	- I've gained a lot of tacit knowledge about writing; I feel as if there is less of a barrier between my thoughts and the words on the (digital) paper. 
	
- Describe your writing process and how it has evolved over the semester?
	- For most work in English class, I generally start just by thinking for a while. I create quite extensive outlines, starting with fluid and undeveloped ideas; through research and more thinking, I move to an outline describing my idea flow. I gather a "Quote Bin" containing evidence, and begin writing. Throughout the course of the semester, the time spent writing has shrank relative to the time spent outlining. 
	
- Describe the progress youâ€™ve made in your ability to understand a text, to identify important moments, to annotate them, and to create good questions to bring to class?
	- This semester, I've tried to move from close reading to derive possible meanings to close reading to understand the broader concepts of the text. I have tried to not close read simply for the sake of close reading, but rather to use close reading as a tool for understanding the text at a broader level. This philosophy has helped me do all the skills listed above. 

- What aspect of your performance in English class are you most proud about this semester (writing process, discussion skills, close reading, a specific assignment)?
	- When in quarantine this long, it's hard not to just let the days slip by without really experiencing or engaging in them. While it sounds mundane, I'm proud of being mentally present to every English class, and never just "sitting through" them. 

- What are your goals in English for next semester? Set at least two specific goals and describe how you will meet them.
	- I've been getting a lot of value out of group projects, just having people to bounce ideas off of and learn from. This type of interaction is much more limited nowadays; next semester, I would like to engage in more of them. 
	- For writing pieces, I often entirely change what I am writing about multiple times because I'm not happy with the ideas in them. I end up scrapping a lot of work and a lot of time. Next semester, I would like to reduce this work and time lost.
