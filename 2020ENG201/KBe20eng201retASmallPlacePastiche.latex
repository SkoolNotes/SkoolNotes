\subsection{Assignment guidelines}\label{assignment-guidelines}}

After reading and analyzing Kincaid's book, you have a better
understanding of rhetorical purpose and techniques. Using Kincaid as
inspiration, and using at least three of her techniques (parentheses,
tone, anaphora, personal pronouns, labyrinthine sentence, em-dashes,
etc.), write a rhetorical pastiche on one of the prompts below.

In addition to your pastiche, please provide a short reflection. You
should explain your rhetorical purpose as well as the techniques and
elements of style you are trying to imitate (this means you will need to
reflect a bit on Kincaid's techniques, so that you can explain what
aspects of her writing you've been inspired by). Your reflection is a
chance to explain what you want to accomplish, in case it doesn't fully
come through in your piece, as well as to demonstrate your understanding
of rhetorical techniques.

\hypertarget{conflicts-in-identity-and-place}{%
\subsubsection{Conflicts in identity and
place}\label{conflicts-in-identity-and-place}}

In A Small Place Kincaid describes a conflicted relationship with
identity, place, and the past, at times nostalgic, at times combative.
Write about some aspect of your life---a part of your identity, a
favorite place, your spoken/written languages, a relationship---that
evokes contradiction and conflict for you. You may employ an implicit
argument in your essay (like Kincaid's), but you \textbf{must} have an
explicit argument to articulate in your reflection.

\hypertarget{responsible-travel}{%
\subsubsection{Responsible travel}\label{responsible-travel}}

Kincaid begins her text with a mockery of ``you,'' an assumed
pasty-faced (read: white), European tourist visiting Antigua. Reflect on
your position as a sometimes-tourist, privileged at least to some
extent. Possible intended audiences include American friends and family
unaware of the complicated power dynamics of travelling in non-Western
and/or post-colonial countries, or the ``locals'' of said country:
Antiguans, Peruvians, Costa Ricans, or others.

\hypertarget{solutions-for-issues-based-in-poverty}{%
\subsubsection{Solutions for issues based in
poverty}\label{solutions-for-issues-based-in-poverty}}

Critiques of philanthropy often suggest it is motivated by a colonial
mindset (``white savior complex,'' ``white volunteerism''). Yet the fact
remains that poverty proliferates and many aid organizations work to
alleviate illness, destitution, and inequity. Use the Poverty Action Lab
site (\url{https://www.povertyactionlab.org/} (Links to an external
site.)) to suggest a solution for some \textbf{manageable} issue based
in poverty. Note about navigating the site: You may find it useful to
start using either ``Regions'' or ``Sectors''; ``evaluations'' and
``publications'' motivate issues and provide solutions (policy
proposals).

Who ( but not really who ( not one person anyway, why should you assume
that you already know who it will be? ), I mean, what kind of person (
or really, personality, because that is what matters right? What is a
person but their personality, maybe their looks, their phisique but that
varies with age ( but then again what doesn't vary with age? Personality
is ever chaging, at times slower yet but often faster than looks might.
), so then, I suppose, who now? ), or rather, what kind of interaction (
it boils down to this, doesn't it? It doesn't matter who they really are
alone, because in the end what you see of them is what you see with
them.. so really who is a good fit? ) warrents such dramatic measures? )
should you let get close to you?

\hypertarget{draft-0.2}{%
\section{Draft 0.2}\label{draft-0.2}}

Who ( or maybe not who\ldots{} because it's not a single person. How do
you know you already know who it might be? Or rather, what kind of
person--or maybe I'm asking what kind of personality? ( Because what is
a person if not their personality? ( Looks, you say, physique. But that
changes all the time. This decision is a big one, and its not something
that should change with a dab of makeup. Just as you wouldn't avoid
buying a house if a loud plane flew overhead while you were visiting. Of
course, you might take pause if loud planes often fly overhead, just as
you might take pause if their appearance is often untidy. But
personality is what we are here for right? Atleast, that's what they all
say. ) So what kind of personality are you seeking? ( It's like walking
into a vast store, with the various personalities laid out on the
shelves for all to see. Kindness, people say. Intelligence, ambition,
loyalty, forgiveness. Some of the aisles have well polished stripes,
where countless reflecting minds have picked the common traits off the
shelf. But might you shy away from the crowds and visit the dark aisles
at the rear, with its dusty boxes and subpar lighting? Who knows,
perhaps there will be something golden. ) How can one know what it is
they want? And how can one find this store of clairity? ( Because
everyone's looking for it, I can tell you that. When they're alone, or
maybe with a trusted friend, they plan out which aisles they will visit,
in what order, and what to do if something is on sale or suddenly
expensive. But do they ever make it to that store, are they ever able to
carry out their meticulous plan? No, not usually. Usually the don't make
it at all, or they get dizzy in the revolving door at the entrance and
spend their time inside in a daze. Humans tend to let their emotions
overrun them at the most inconveinient times ). All this is assuming
that you know what you want, and to be fair, most people think they know
what they want. But are you sure that you know what you want? ( So far,
you've only been considering what would work for you at this moment. But
with everyone changing all the time, it's like trying to find a boat
floating the perfect distance away, and expecting them to stay at that
distance all the time. Even if you put down anchor, the slack in the
chain will let you drift.. it won't last. )

They say that you become who you are around, but those around you too
are perpetually changing. Should you choose someone seems to click with
you now, or someone who's current image is who you want to be? How can
you even know who someone is at this moment, not to mention who they
will become? Who should you let get close to you?
