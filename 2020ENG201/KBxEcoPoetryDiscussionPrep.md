## Thoreau: Walden

stranger to speech

listen for the waves/words with practice

only practiced ear can catch thoughts

breaths in the mist, breaths in the tranquility

> breath in vs. discourse




pebbled lips?

thought = waves

stars come to catch blessing of our expression..?

sun exhbits himself as impartial? 

narrow skylight?

blue vault that spans thy floud = sky?

gods of wind, dipped pens in mist -- thought? 


sun tranfered and reprinted -> reflection on the ocean


winds wright clouds? made out of mist?
