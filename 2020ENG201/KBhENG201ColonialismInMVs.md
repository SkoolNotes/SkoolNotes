# Colonialism in MVs
## Hungry Like a Wolf — Sri Lanka
* Depicting individuals as animals/savages
* White people are in power w/o accountability! Images of "white explorers"
    * Flipping tables
    * Trekking jungles
* Deeply problematic (outright racism?) => "Indiana Jones"-y

## Hello Kitty — Japan
* High energy dumbness
    * "Truly eye-browing, taking cultural-appropriation to a highly cringe-worthy levels" 
    * Contention between whether it is cultural-appropriation vs. outright racism
    
## Loosing You — South Africa
* British flag everywhere!
* Transposing British culture upon others
* Highlighting the assimilation => Colonizer/Colonizee relationship
* Consumarism 
    * Hair
    * Cloths
    * Transportation
    * _All Defined by Consumarism

## Wildest Dreams — Tanzenia + LA
* Marked African sceneray as a "background"/irrelevant
* No Tanzenian culture depicted, only animals => "It's only the white person's role to conserve"
