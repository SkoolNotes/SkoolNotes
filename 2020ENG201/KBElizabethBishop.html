      <p>Elizabeth Bishop conveys the widespread cultural sentiment of distrust and deflated optimism through the vivid, cynical imagery in her poem “Going to the Bakery.” This poem was written during a time of massive poverty in Brazil, roughly four years after a coup catalyzed massive changes in monetary policy {citation}. The impact of these policies is perhaps most clearly referenced when the speaker describes their currency as “<em>my</em> terrific money”{citation}. Notably, this is the only place throughout the entire poem that the author uses italics for emphasis. At the time, Brazil was in poverty; distrust towards the government was rampant. Much like other times of economic and political turmoil, it was common to use a form of currency not managed by the legal system, hence Bishop’s use of italics: “<em>my</em> terrific money” (citation). Bishop’s distrust in the government is also reflected earlier in the poem, where she describes her surroundings as having “the iridescence of dying, flaccid, toy balloons” {citation}. Balloons are a symbol of almost child-like hope – a promise of joy. Here Bishop describes them, however, as “dying” and “flaccid,” just as the country’s sense of hope deflated while the new government failed to lift them out of poverty {citation}. Bishop chooses to use toy balloons to represent optimism, retrospectively calling it childish and naive. The speaker then enters a bakery, describing “the gooey tarts” as “red and sore,” the “loaves of bread… like yellow-fever victims laid out in a crowded ward” (citation). The promise of joy, and therefore hope, inherent in pastries is not only deflated like the balloons, but also tainted and repulsive on a visceral level. Hope is an illness; hope is <em>sickly</em>. Ironically, this outlook on hope simply maintains that which causes it; without hope, one cannot achieve change, making it deadly to require change to be hopeful.</p>
