## Evidence bin
- *"[The African continent] had ceased to be a blank space of delightful mystery … it had become a place of darkness. … But there was in it one river especially … resembling an immense snake uncoiled .… It fascinated me as a snake would a bird — a silly little bird. … The snake had charmed me."* (9) 
- *"The man seemed young … He had tied a bit of white worsted around his neck — Why? Where did he get it? Was it a badge — an ornament — a charm — a propitiatory act?"* (20)
- *"The approach to this Kurtz grubbing for ivory in the wretched bush was beset by as many dangers as though he had been an enchanted princess sleeping in a fabulous castle."* (52)
- *"The thing was to know what [Kurts himself] belonged to, how many powers of darkness claimed him for their own. … He had taken a high seat amoungst the devils of the sand — I mean literally. You can't understand"* (60)
- *"[Kurtz] began [his work] with the argument that we whites, from the point of development we had arrived at, 'must necessarily appear to them [savages] in the nature of supernatural beings — we approach them with the might as of a deity' … From that point he soared and took me wit him … it made me tingle with enthusiasm. This was the unbounded power of eloquence — of words — of burning nobel words.'"* (61)
- *"[Kurtz] had the power to charm or frighten rudimentary souls into an aggravated witch-dance in his honor; he could also fill the small souls of the pilgrims with bitter misgivings.*" (62)
- *"Instantly, … a cry arose whose shrillness pierced the still air like a sharp arrow flying straight to the heart of the land; and, as if by enchantment, stream of human beings — of naken human beings — with speas in their hands, with bows, with shields, with wild glances and asvage movement, were poured into the clearing by the dark-faced and pnsive forest."
