## Prompt
For this assignment, you will craft a literary analysis essay that shows your understanding and close reading of a thematic aspect of Roy’s _The God of Small Things_. As always, close reading can involve tracking a repetition of some type in the text, including but not limited to repetitions in diction, images, structure, syntax, or characters’ behaviors. You might also think about tracking a change of some kind in the novel. 

You may think of this analysis in two pieces: 

-   A deep engagement with textual evidence, close reading, and a thematic scope of Roy’s _The God of Small Things_
-   A tracking and analysis of a pattern, theme, motif, or element of the narrative. Your analysis MUST include the significance of this tracking. It is not enough to notice a pattern, you must examine WHY and HOW that pattern functions within the broader scope of the narrative.

## Evidence bin
- (Holes) “Wild creepers burst through latente banks and spill across the flooded roads. Boats ply in the bazaars. And small fish appear in the puddles that fill the PWD potholes on the highways.”
- (Holes) “Steelshrill police whistles pierced holes in the Noise Umbrella. Through the jagged umbrella holes Rahel could see pieces of red sky.” (w.r.t. communism march)
- (Smash) “Steelshrill police whistles pierced holes in the Noise Umbrella. Through the jagged umbrella holes Rahel could see pieces of red sky.”
- (Holes + Squash) “Vellya Paapen had assured the twins that there was no such thing in the world as a black cat. He said that there were only black cat-shaped holes in the Universe. // Squashed Miss Mitten-shaped stains in the Universe. // Squashed frog-shaped stains in the Universe.”
- (Holes) “Chacko marveled at how someone so small and undefined, so vague in her resemblances, could so completely command the attention, the love, the sanity, of a grown man. // When he left, he felt that something had been torn out of him. Something big. // But Joe was dead now. Killed in a car crash. Dead as a doorknob. A Joe-shaped Hole in the Universe.”
- (Holes) “Estha wouldn’t look up. His mind was full of trains. He blocked the light from the door. An Estha-shaped Hole in the Universe.” (no, train was not mentioned elsewhere)
