## Prompt
For this assignment, you will craft a literary analysis essay that shows your understanding and close reading of a thematic aspect of Roy’s _The God of Small Things_. As always, close reading can involve tracking a repetition of some type in the text, including but not limited to repetitions in diction, images, structure, syntax, or characters’ behaviors. You might also think about tracking a change of some kind in the novel. 

You may think of this analysis in two pieces: 

-   A deep engagement with textual evidence, close reading, and a thematic scope of Roy’s _The God of Small Things_
-   A tracking and analysis of a pattern, theme, motif, or element of the narrative. Your analysis MUST include the significance of this tracking. It is not enough to notice a pattern, you must examine WHY and HOW that pattern functions within the broader scope of the narrative.
