## Prompt
For this assignment, you will craft a literary analysis essay that shows your understanding and close reading of a thematic aspect of Roy’s _The God of Small Things_. As always, close reading can involve tracking a repetition of some type in the text, including but not limited to repetitions in diction, images, structure, syntax, or characters’ behaviors. You might also think about tracking a change of some kind in the novel. 

You may think of this analysis in two pieces: 

-   A deep engagement with textual evidence, close reading, and a thematic scope of Roy’s _The God of Small Things_
-   A tracking and analysis of a pattern, theme, motif, or element of the narrative. Your analysis MUST include the significance of this tracking. It is not enough to notice a pattern, you must examine WHY and HOW that pattern functions within the broader scope of the narrative.

## Evidence bin
### Holes and Smashed
- (Holes) “Wild creepers burst through latente banks and spill across the flooded roads. Boats ply in the bazaars. And small fish appear in the puddles that fill the PWD potholes on the highways.”
- (Holes) “Steelshrill police whistles pierced holes in the Noise Umbrella. Through the jagged umbrella holes Rahel could see pieces of red sky.” (w.r.t. communism march)
- (Smash) “Steelshrill police whistles pierced holes in the Noise Umbrella. Through the jagged umbrella holes Rahel could see pieces of red sky.”
- (Holes + Squash) “Vellya Paapen had assured the twins that there was no such thing in the world as a black cat. He said that there were only black cat-shaped holes in the Universe. // Squashed Miss Mitten-shaped stains in the Universe. // Squashed frog-shaped stains in the Universe.”
- (Holes) “Chacko marveled at how someone so small and undefined, so vague in her resemblances, could so completely command the attention, the love, the sanity, of a grown man. // When he left, he felt that something had been torn out of him. Something big. // But Joe was dead now. Killed in a car crash. Dead as a doorknob. A Joe-shaped Hole in the Universe.”
- (Holes) “Estha wouldn’t look up. His mind was full of trains. He blocked the light from the door. An Estha-shaped Hole in the Universe.” (no, train was not mentioned elsewhere)
- (Holes) “How marvelous!” Margaret Kochamma said. 'It’s a sort of sniffing! Do the Men and Women do it to each other too?'' She hadn’t meant it to sound quite like that, and she blushed. An embarrassed schoolteacher-shaped Hole in the Universe.”
- (Holes) “Esthappen and Rahel both knew that there were several perpetrators (besides themselves) that day. But only one victim. ... He left behind a Hole in the Universe through which darkness poured like liquid tar.” 
- (Holes) “She concealed her anguish under the brisk, practical mask of a schoolteacher. The stern, schoolteacher-shaped Hole in the Universe (who sometimes slapped).”

### Bottles and Cans
- (Bottles) “Red bananas ripen. Jackfruits burst. Dissolute bluebottles hum vacuously in the fruity air.”
- (Bottles) “She even locked her sad, paint-flaking fridge, where she kept her week’s supply of cream buns that Kochu Maria brought her from Bestbakery in Kottayam. And the two bottles of rice water that she drank instead of ordinary water.” (w.r.t. Baby Kochamma)
- (Bottle (sealing)) “He commuted his pension and provident fund to buy a Bharat bottle-sealing machine. Mammachi just ran it like a large kitchen. Chacko had it registered as a partnership and informed Mammachi that she was the Sleeping Partner. He invested in equipment (canning machines, cauldrons, cookers) and expanded the labor force. Almost immediately, the financial slide began”
