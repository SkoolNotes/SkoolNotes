Begin here:

## Jack's Intro 0-1

How does Marlow’s inner perspective come into dialog with the darkness along his journey?

Can we look beyond his perspective of the darkness?

This asks two questions. What does Marlow's language reveal to us about his journey and how, ultimately, does his internalities reveals?

Two stances: Marlow Brings Darkness, or Darkness Darkens Marlow


## The Discussion

The leader's job is to "moderate" the two others; others, DO NOT ADVANCE THE ARGUMENT. Let the leader do it.

Bounce off ideas, and repeat/reply/clarify/ask questions. Feel free to bud in.

### Ryan's Opening — Marlow's Perspective brings Darkness 1-5
* Initially, Ryan believes that it is difficult to see beyond Marlow's perspective
* Story is from his perspective => so, of course, its Marlow that welds the darkness!
* However, it is possible to gauge the darkness by analyzing the dialog with other characters to find their perspectives to find out what they say
* Issue! only perspectives we get is through European colonists is ultimately biased
	* We mostly get European views
	* And the two times a native speaks, its...
		* "Eat 'im"
		* "and Mistah Kurtz, He Dead
	* Because we only have two instances — and they are gramatically incoherent sentences —  can't accurately gauge the darkness through non-marlow
	* Mention Acheobe
	
**CONFLIGHT! line** There is possibility to gauge darkness of land through simply analyzing the environment to take it as it is from objective language of Marlow.

### Zach — Darkness already present 5-9
* Both his environment and himself is dark
* Surroundings are already dark b/c of Europeans
* Find quotes about
	1. People dying; people chained together
	2. How that influence marlow's view, before and after
* Provide transition: there are unseen dark properties of his environment that he does not see; why? 
* **Some analysis** It does not really seem to darken Marlow  — why is he not affected? Oh! Right! Because... MARLOW IS A BLOODY RACIST!
	* Undereacts to black people dying next to him
	* Compared to to like... Kurtz dying, or his Helmsmen dying — lots of ceremony and discussion
* Marlow bloody racist => doesn’t see some darkness

**CONFLIGHT!** they fit the darkness

### Jack — the darkness was always there (b/c Europeans), but Marlow also is a contributor to it. 9-12
- Hell example — language of hell, except actually just reality.
- "The earth seemed unearthly. we are accustomed ... but here— you could look at a thing mostrous and free": indeed, Marlow just adding to the point
- Indeed: Marlow could _percieve_ the darkness: but its a darkness of his own creation from his mind
* Then realized that, if there were to be an example, a place to show the objective example of the darkness, we could get another perspective potentially through convos he has with other people to pick up on things that they have said
* Perhaps have a scene with the cannibals — 



- Comparing normal features of the land as hell — 43
