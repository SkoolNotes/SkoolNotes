### Ryan's Opening — Marlow's Perspective brings Darkness 1-5
* Initially, Ryan believes that it is difficult to see beyond Marlow's perspective
* Story is from his perspective => so, of course, its Marlow that welds the darkness!
* However, it is possible to gauge the darkness by analyzing the dialog with other characters
* Only perspectives we get is through European colonists is ultimately biased



**CONFLIGHT!**

### Zach — Darkness already present 5-9
* Both his environment and himself is dark
* Surroundings are already dark b/c of Europeans
* Find quotes about
	1. People dying; people chained together
	2. How that influence marlow's view, before and after
	3. But! It does not really seem to darken Marlow
* There are unseen dark properties of his environment that he does not see 
* Some analysis — why is he not affected? Oh! Right! Because... MARLOW IS A BLOODY RACIST!
	
**CONFLIGHT!**

* Perhaps have a scene with the cannibals — 



- Comparing normal features of the land as hell — 43
