## Jack's Intro

How does Marlow’s inner perspective come into dialog with the darkness along his journey?

### Ryan's Opening — Marlow's Perspective brings Darkness
* Initially, Ryan believes that there are no ways to show that it is difficult to see beyond Marlow's perspective
* However, it is possible to gauge the darkness by analyzing the dialog with other characters
* Find quotes about
	1. How others are happy/not dark
	2. (optimally) How marlow darkens the same scene

**CONFLIGHT!**

### Zach — Darkness Darkens Marlow
* Both his environment and himself is dark
* Surroundings are already dark b/c of Europeans
* Find quotes about
	1. People dying; people chained together
	2. How that influence marlow's view, before and after
	
**CONFLIGHT!**

* Perhaps have a scene with the cannibals — 



- Comparing normal features of the land as hell — 43
