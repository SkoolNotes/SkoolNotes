Heart of Darkness Analytical Essay

English 10: Landscapes of the Self and Other

For your first literary analysis paper, you will be coming up with your own interpretive argument about some aspect of Heart of Darkness.

OPTION 1: Choose a recurring word, motif, pattern, or character

Choose a word, motif, pattern, or character that you’ve noticed throughout the book, and construct an analytical, argumentative essay around it. For example, you might want to look at specific moments where you see “light” and “dark” imagery. Or, maybe you want to look at every time the word “wilderness” shows up. Perhaps you want to analyze the role of women in the book, or the way that Marlow writes about the jungle. Again, if you choose a theme we’ve discussed in class, you need to go above and beyond what we’ve talked about—you need to add something new to the conversation. For this option, I recommend looking at a repetition or a character that/who seems to change throughout the book. If you look at a changing use of the same language or at the arc of a character, it will be easier for you to construct a forward-moving argument.

OPTION 2: Choose a moment in the text

Pick an excerpt of no more than 1/3-1/2 a page from the book, and construct an analytical, argumentative essay around it. To do this well you need to pay close attention to language: word choice, sentence structure, tone, other literary/rhetorical techniques, etc. If you choose a passage we’ve already discussed in class, you need to go above and beyond what we’ve talked about—you need to add something new to the conversation. Our recommendation is to choose an excerpt we haven’t treated in detail together. 

You will likely make connections to other parts of the text, particularly as you engage broader implications in your argument. However, the focus of your piece should be on your excerpt.

OPTION 3: Propose your own analytical adventure
