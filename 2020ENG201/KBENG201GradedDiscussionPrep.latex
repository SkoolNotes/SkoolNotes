\subsection{Jack's Intro 0-1}\label{jacks-intro-0-1}}

How does Marlow's inner perspective come into dialog with the darkness
along his journey?

Can we look beyond his perspective of the darkness?

This asks two questions. What does Marlow's language reveal to us about
his journey and how, ultimately, does his internalities reveals?

Two stances: Marlow Brings Darkness, or Marlow Sees Darkness

\hypertarget{the-discussion}{%
\subsection{The Discussion}\label{the-discussion}}

The leader's job is to ``moderate'' the two others; others, DO NOT
ADVANCE THE ARGUMENT. Let the leader do it.

Bounce off ideas, and repeat/reply/clarify/ask questions. Feel free to
bud in.

\subsubsection{Ryan's Opening --- Marlow's Perspective brings Darkness
1-5}\label{ryans-opening-marlows-perspective-brings-darkness-1-5}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Initially, Ryan believes that it is difficult to see beyond Marlow's
  perspective
\item
  Story is from his perspective =\textgreater{} so, of course, its
  Marlow that welds the darkness!
\item
  However, it is possible to gauge the darkness by analyzing the dialog
  with other characters to find their perspectives to find out what they
  say
\item
  Issue! only perspectives we get is through European colonists is
  ultimately biased

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We mostly get European views
  \item
    And the two times a native speaks, its\ldots{}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      ``Eat 'im''
    \item
      "and Mistah Kurtz, He Dead
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Because we only have two instances --- and they are gramatically
    incoherent sentences --- can't accurately gauge the darkness through
    non-marlow
  \item
    Mention Acheobe
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{CONFLIGHT! line} There is possibility to gauge darkness of land
through simply analyzing the environment to take it as it is from
objective language of Marlow.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Both his environment and himself is dark
\item
  Surroundings are already dark b/c of Europeans
\item
  Find quotes about

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    People dying; people chained together
  \item
    How that influence marlow's view, before and after
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Provide transition: there are unseen dark properties of his
  environment that he does not see; why?
\item
  \textbf{Some analysis} It does not really seem to darken Marlow ---
  why is he not affected? Oh! Right! Because\ldots{} MARLOW IS A BLOODY
  RACIST!

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Undereacts to black people dying next to him
  \item
    Compared to to like\ldots{} Kurtz dying, or his Helmsmen dying ---
    lots of ceremony and discussion
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Marlow bloody racist =\textgreater{} dosen't see some darkness
\end{itemize}

\textbf{CONFLIGHT!} Maybe Marlow's racist lens could be looked at from
the opposite way! Darkness is, actually, everywhere\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Darkness is \textbf{everywhere} --- even on the Thems (pg 5) --- but
  Marlow could only percieve the darkness that he choose to percieve.
  Marlow does not bring darkness, and Marlow does not see Darknss in
  Africa. Darkness is everywhere and it is just what Marlow's perception
  illustrates
\item
  Hell example --- language of hell, except language actually just show
  reality
\item
  ``The earth seemed unearthly. we are accustomed \ldots{} but here---
  you could look at a thing mostrous and free'': indeed, Marlow
  admitting that perception shaped his senses --- racist marlow labels
  africa as moster, and chooses to see it here.
\item
  Then realized that, if there were to be an example, a place to show
  the objective example of the darkness, we could get another
  perspective potentially through convos he has with other people to
  pick up on things that they have said
\item
  Comparing normal features of the land as hell --- 43
