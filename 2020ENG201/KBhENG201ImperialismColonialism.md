# So, what _is_ Colonialism?
> Colonialism is a practice of domination

* Not very modern
    * Acient Greek Mediterranean Colonies
    * Roman Europe Colonies.+ African Colonies
    * Moors
    * Ottomans
* Time, space irrelevant, but TECHNOLOGY makes it easier
* Colonialism, a synonym of imperialism?
    * NO!
    * Similarities
        * Both were forms of conquest
        * Both involve mostly European settlers
    * Differences
        * Colonialism => Europeans take over + Bring their families
            * Europeans go there
            * They integrate into and change the society
        * Imperialism => Europeans take over + Assimilate then leave
            * Europeans go there
            * They setup their rule, and, (potentially) through local councils, exercise power
        * Rapid Imperialism brings forth "Empires", but the U.S., a large colonist, is a "Republic", for they bring the colonies under their own care and bring their people there
    * Usually, Colonialism is a Consequence of Imperialism, as in…
        * People go there and establish their rule ("Imperialists")
        * When society is somewhat assimilated, bring their own people ("Colonists")
        * Profit!

> Neither imperialism nor colonialism is a simple act of accumulation and acquisition. Both are supported and perhaps even impelled by impressive ideological formations that include notions that certain territories and people _require_ and beseech domination, as well as forms of knowledge affiliated with domination: the vocabulary of classic nineteenth-century imperial culture is plentiful with words and concepts like “inferior” or “subject races,” “subordinate peoples,” “dependency,” “expansion,” and “authority.”
