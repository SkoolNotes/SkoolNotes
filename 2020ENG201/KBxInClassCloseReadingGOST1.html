            <p>prompt</p>
            <pre><code>_Instructions:_ Select one of the following citations from Roy’s _The God of Small Things_ for your in-class close reading writing. Be sure to examine the specific denotation and connotations of Roy’s language. Identify rhetorical and/or literary devices that the author uses and then connect them to meaning.  Please be sure the first sentence of your paragraph states the author, the title of the novel (in italics), and the basic context of the excerpt. In the last sentence or two of your paragraph, connect your close readings to a broader theme that is present in the novel. 300-450 words.

            Rubric Categories:

            -   Understanding Literature
            -   Close Reading
            -   Structure &amp; Mechanics
            -   Writer’s Voice

            Please create your paragraph in a Google Doc and submit it to Canvas at the end of class. You will be granted the entire period to work; however, you have until Sunday evening to make any edits or changes to your submission. All we ask is that you change the color of any additional content; for instance, you typically type in black font, but in order for us to see any adjustments or edits that you made, please add them in a different color (e.g. blue or green).

            1) She lay in it in her yellow Crimplene bell-bottoms with her hair in a ribbon and her Made-in-England go-go bag that she loved. Her face was pale and as wrinkled as a dhobi’s thumb from being in water for too long. The congregation gathered around the coffin, and the yellow church swelled like a throat with the sound of sad singing. The priests with curly beards swung pots of frankincense on chains and never smiled at babies the way they did on usual Sundays. (6)

            2) Chacko said:

            -   You don’t _go_ to Oxford. You _read_ at Oxford.

            And

            -   After _reading_ at Oxford, you _come down._

            “Down to earth, d’you mean?” Ammu would ask. “_That_ you definitely do. Like your famous airplanes.”

              Ammu said that the sad but entirely predictable fate of Chacko’s airplanes was an impartial measure of his abilities. (55)

            3) A few months later Miss Mitten was killed by a milk van in Hobart, across the road from a cricket oval. To the twins there was a hidden justice in the fact that the milk van had been _reversing._ (58)

            4) When he finished, Estha moved the cans to the basin in front of the mirror. He washed his hands and wet his hair. Then, dwarfed by the size of Ammu’s comb that was too big for him, he reconstructed his puff carefully. Slicked back, then pushed forward and swiveled sideways at the very end. He returned the comb to his pocket, stepped off the tins and put them back with the bottle and swab and broom. He bowed to them all. The whole shooting match. The bottle, the broom, the cans, the limp floorswab. (92)</code></pre>
