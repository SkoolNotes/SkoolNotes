```
Chacko said:
-   You don’t _go_ to Oxford. You _read_ at Oxford.
And
-   After _reading_ at Oxford, you _come down._

“Down to earth, d’you mean?” Ammu would ask. “_That_ you definitely do. Like your famous airplanes.”
Ammu said that the sad but entirely predictable fate of Chacko’s airplanes was an impartial measure of his abilities. (55)
```

Reading, the double entendre. "Study (an academic subject) at a university." (OED, AA) However, in this passage, there's also "understand or interpret the nature or significance of." (OED, AB).

Come down — a sense of superority — a sense of criticism w.r.t. Chacko has a sense of superority. Chaco's aeromodeling kit kept crashing, shows dichotomy between reality and fiction. 

Chacko's airplones, kits — arranged — that he always messes up. Similar to his running of the factory. Prearranged systems that he messes up.

Effect of sarcasm: famous. *Is famous sacrasm??*

The sense of British superority used against him. Infatuation with titles.

1. Infatuation with titles and male chavinism

You don't go to oxford, you "understand" at oxford. And after you understand at oxford, you rid yourself of your corrupt ways. One does not simply head to oxford, one attempts to see and understand (Luke 19:5), and Come Down to rid of sins.

Inherent sense of superority, for Chacko, Oxford is the tree that allows him to see Jesus. Marxist.

Ammu instead offers an alternate interpretation, instead of meeting a Jesus like figure, one actually meets a harsher figure: the ground. One acutally comes down to earth, and, instead of seeing Jesus and achiving salvation, chacko bites the dirt.... by destroying prebuilt systems. Unexpected use of famous offers sharp dichotomy
