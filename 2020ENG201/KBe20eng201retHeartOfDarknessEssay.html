            <pre><code>Heart of Darkness Analytical Essay

            English 10: Landscapes of the Self and Other

             

            For your first literary analysis paper, you will be coming up with your own interpretive argument about some aspect of Heart of Darkness.

             

            OPTION 1: Choose a recurring word, motif, pattern, or character

            Choose a word, motif, pattern, or character that you’ve noticed throughout the book, and construct an analytical, argumentative essay around it. For example, you might want to look at specific moments where you see “light” and “dark” imagery. Or, maybe you want to look at every time the word “wilderness” shows up. Perhaps you want to analyze the role of women in the book, or the way that Marlow writes about the jungle. Again, if you choose a theme we’ve discussed in class, you need to go above and beyond what we’ve talked about—you need to add something new to the conversation. For this option, I recommend looking at a repetition or a character that/who seems to change throughout the book. If you look at a changing use of the same language or at the arc of a character, it will be easier for you to construct a forward-moving argument.

             

            OPTION 2: Choose a moment in the text

            Pick an excerpt of no more than 1/3-1/2 a page from the book, and construct an analytical, argumentative essay around it. To do this well you need to pay close attention to language: word choice, sentence structure, tone, other literary/rhetorical techniques, etc. If you choose a passage we’ve already discussed in class, you need to go above and beyond what we’ve talked about—you need to add something new to the conversation. Our recommendation is to choose an excerpt we haven’t treated in detail together. 

             

            You will likely make connections to other parts of the text, particularly as you engage broader implications in your argument. However, the focus of your piece should be on your excerpt.

             

            OPTION 3: Propose your own analytical adventure

            If neither option 1 or 2 appeals to you, please schedule time to meet with me during tutorial to discuss a topic of your choice. 




            Basic requirements:

            Your essay will need to be 2-3 pages in length.
            Your essay should include, at least, 2 thoughtfully selected and analyzed direct citations per body paragraph. 
            You should double-space your paper, use 1” margins, use 12-point font (preferably Times New Roman), and use MLA formatting (a four-line header, last name and page number, citations, etc.).
            Include a works cited entry for Heart of Darkness at the end of your essay.

            <li><p>I want to analyze the language on the second half of page 92 &gt; “I thought his memory was like the other memories of the dead that accumulate in every man’s life—a vague impress on the brain of shadows that had fallen on it in their swift and final passage; but before the high and ponderous door, between the tall houses of a street as still and decorous as a well-kept alley in a cemetery, I had a vision of him on the stretcher, opening his mouth voraciously, as if to devour all the earth with all its mankind. He lived then before me; he lived as much as he had ever lived—a shadow insatiable of splendid appearances, of frightful realities; a shadow darker than the shadow of the night, and draped nobly in the folds of a gorgeous eloquence. The vision seemed to enter the house with me—the stretcher, the phantom-bearers, the wild crowd of obedient worshipers the gloom of the forests, the glitter of the reach between the murky bends, the beat of the drum, regular and muffled like the beating of a heart—the heart of a conquering darkness. It was a moment of triumph for the wilderness, an invading and vengeful rush which, it seemed to me, I would have to keep back alone for the salvation of another soul. And the memory of what I had heard him say afar there, with the horned shapes stirring at my back, in the glow of fires, within the patient woods, those broken phrases came back to me, were heard again in their ominous and terrifying simplicity. I remembered his abject pleading, his abject threats, the colossal scale of his vile desires, the meanness, the torment, the tempestuous anguish of his soul. And later on I seemed to see his collected languid manner, when he said one day, ‘This lot of ivory now is really mine. The Company did not pay for it. I collected it myself at a very great personal risk. I am afraid they will try to claim it as theirs though. H’m. It is a difficult case. What do you think I ought to do—resist? Eh? I want no more than justice.’ … He wanted no more than justice—no more than justice. I rang the bell before a mahogany door on the first floor, and while I waited he seemed to stare at me out of the glassy panel—stare with that wide and immense stare embracing condemning, loathing all the universe. I seemed to hear the whispered cry, ‘The horror! The horror!’’</p></li>

            <p>How does it make me feel? - The text feels dreamy, abstract, and almost hallucinatory - Kurtz is seen as immortalized, due to his extreme intentions and the raw tangibility of the original experience - the cadence of writing draws the reader and brings them along for an involuntary, exhilarating series of visions - the above feelins show that Kurtz and his intentions are immortalized and impressed upon marlow, perhaps the raw tangibility shows the primal, nearly supernatural impact of the wilderness in the heart of darkness - because what is “natural” for them is the western world</p>
