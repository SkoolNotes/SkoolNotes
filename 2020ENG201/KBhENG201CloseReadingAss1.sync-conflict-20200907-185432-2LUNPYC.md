## Claim Synthesis
### Development phase – How and So-What
- *The flowers are a symbol of the spirits of (??), and, by proxy, the birdman*
    - Evidence
        - He even said so
        - His leaving caused it to turn red
        - His dying/disappearing/escaping caused it to turn white
    - So what, how is this theamatically important?
- *The Mob-Mentality exhibited by the Portuguese marks a disorder with the wild spirits — of which the Baopap flower is an indicator — and the birdman is the communicator of that spirit."
    - Evidence
        - He even said so
        - His leaving caused it to turn red
        - His dying/disappearing/escaping caused it to turn white
        - Crushing the spirit underfeet => harm to kid
    - Ok, so what is the CENTRAL LINE OF THEME
- *The symbol of the flower in the BRB alerts the reader of the danger of the mob-disregard for natural spirits — the flowers being an indicator of that spirit*

### Defluff
*The symbol of the flower in the BRB alerts the reader of the danger of the mob-disregard for natural spirits — the flowers being an indicator of that spirit*

The flower is a symbol for the Natural, Wild spirit that the birdman is communicating.         

- He even said so
- His capture brought color change => "The Spirit is in Flux"
- Crushing the spirit underfeet brought harm to kid

Warning the readers of the dangers from mob-mentality + selfishness + FOMO + caused bypassing of validation of assumptions.

Pause! Problem: how does one concisely describe Mob-Mentality, Selfishness, and FOMO. => Advocating for own's interests.

**In the Bird-Dreaming Baobadadadbadabap, the author utilises the symbol of the Baopapba's flower as an indicator of the Wild, Natural spirit which the Birdman is a communicator of; through tracking the state of the flowers through the Portugueses' capture of the Birdman, the author warns the reader against the dangers of selfishly advocating for one's own interests.**

- The Birdman literally said that "The Flowers is Where the Spirits Dwell"
- During the Birdman's capture, the spirits fell and is in flux => taking on the duty of communicating the pains of the communicator (Birdman) when the communicator is silenced
- The dying of the child only occurred after the Porchuguese stepped on the flowers
