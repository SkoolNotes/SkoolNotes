# Breakouts
- > What is the heart of darkness?
	- africa, congo river
	- savage = darkness
	- anthropomorphized the continent?
- > Where do we see scientific racism?
	- Phrenology, head and then mental state changes
		- implies Africa is so horrible that its traumatic
		- size of skull used for racism
	- Described in parts instead of individuals
		- Not a specific human, but rather masses of limbs
- > What narrative techniques does Conrad use to distance readers from the plot?
	- Frame based story
		- Modernism (don't know if what we are told is accurate)
		- Contrast with frankenstein frames: we always have quotes
	- Narrator disagrees with Marlow?
	- Past tense
	- Marlow has two modes: one that's dreamy and abstract for describing the nature and the blacks, while the other is normal-ish for talking to whites.
	- Jumpy narrative
		- Doesn't always distinguish between thoughts and events
		- Passage of time isn't clear
		- Fog
	- No names other than Kurtz
		- descriptions, but no other actual names
	- Marlow emotions
		- Marlow stops talking when it gets too intense, pausing before resuming
- Racism
	- So ingrained in the characters and society in the book that it feels natural in the context of the book, but when talking about it in our social context the whole thing feels very racist

# Discussion

# Breakouts again

	- Highly effective at collecting ivory
	- Seen as a genius or superhuman
	- Holds power and strength
	- In charge of a trading post
	- Local figurehead
	- Pioneer into the heart of darkness
	- Mostly heard about through rumors
- > Painting
	- Impressionist? Not too modern or surreal but not too many things going on at once
	- European expansion into africa
		- Blindfolded and carrying a torch into the darkness
		- blindfold - don't know whats going into
		- torch to civilize the natives
	- She's a woman?
		- darkness -> torchlight -> makes her sinister (light reflecting on her face) although she was originally stately
		- Seems 
- > Religious Vocab
