* Intermediate Result: Span of a linearly independent extension of a linearly independent list has more elements than the span of the original list.
** Lemma
  Given a linearly independent list $v = v_1, \ldots, v_k$ where each vector $v_1, \ldots, v_k \in V$ and another vector $v_{k+1}$ which is linearly independent with $v$, show that
$$\text{span}\left(v_1, \ldots, v_k, v_{k+1}\right)$$
contains elements that are not in
$$\text{span}\left(v_1, \ldots, v_k\right)$$
** Proof
   Because $v_{k+1}$ is linearly independent with $v$, it cannot be written as a linear combination of elements in $v$.
