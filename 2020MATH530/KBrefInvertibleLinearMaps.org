- A linear map $T \in \mathcal L(V, W)$ is /invertible/ if there exists a linear map $S\in \mathcal(W, V)$ such that $ST$ equals the identity map on $V$ and $TS$ equals the identity map on $W$.
- A linear map $S \in \mathcal(W, V)$ satisfying $ST = I$ and $TS = I$ is called an /inverse/ of $T$
- If $T$ is invertable, $T^{-1}$ denotes the inverse of $T$

** careful
*** the inverse of a map has to be commutative ($TS = I$ and $ST = I$)
*** the target identity is in one space on one side and in the other space on the other side
** results
*** unique
    any invertible map has exactly one inverse
*** equivalant to injectivity and surjectivity (bijectivity)
    See [[file:KBrefBijectiveFunction.org][bijectivity]]. Iff a map is bijective, then it is invertable.
*** Equivalent Condition with eigenvalues
	if a map has zero as an eigenvalue, then it is singular (5.A exercise 21)
