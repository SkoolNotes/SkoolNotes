# Polynomials 
- See [[KBrefPolynomial]]
## 0 polynomial
- Has degree $-infty$
- Degrees are usually positive, except for the $0$ degree
- "that's too hard, and we're not going to do it here"
## Identically zero
- Like $0$ or $0 x^0$
- Most polynomials are sometimes zero, but polynomials that are "identically zero" means that it's always zero (instead of just sometimes zero)

## $\mathcal{P}_m(F)$
- Polynomials with coefficients in $F$ whose highest degree is $m$
- It can't be "whose degree is exactly $m$" because otherwise you won't have the identity and it won't be closed under addition (in the case where coefficient sum $a_m + b_m = 0$)
### It's a finite dimensional vector space
- $$a_0z^0+...+a_mz^m + b_0z^0 + ... + b_mz^m = (a_0+b_0)z^0 + ... + (a_m+b_m)z^m$$

## Proof of 2.16
- Structure: proof by contradiction

# Linear Independence
- "non-trivial" means "simplest possible", which has usually got the most zeros
