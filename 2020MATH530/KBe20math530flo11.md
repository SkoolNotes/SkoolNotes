# Polynomials 
- See [[KBrefPolynomial]]
## 0 polynomial
- Has degree $-infty$
- Degrees are usually positive, except for the $0$ degree
- "that's too hard, and we're not going to do it here"
## Identically zero
- Like $0$ or $0 x^0$
- Most polynomials are sometimes zero, but polynomials that are "identically zero" means that it's always zero (instead of just sometimes zero)
