* Definitions
** Linear Map
   A linear map is a function/map from one vector space to another such that it satisfies the properties of additivity and homogeneity. Notationally, a linear map $T \in \mathcal L(V, W)$ satisfies $T(a) + T(b) = T(a+b) : a, b \in V$ and $\lambda Ta = T(\lambda a) : \lambda \in \mathbb F, a \in V$
** Null Space
   The null space of a linear map is the space of vectors that are sent to 0 by $T$, aka $\{v : v \in V \land Tv = 0\}$
** Column Space
   The column space of a linear map is the subspace of the codomain that is an output to the map, aka $\{w : Tv = w, v\in V, w\in W\}$
** Homogeneous system of equations
   A system of equations where all the right hand sides are $0$.
** Injective
   When each element in the column space of a map is mapped to by exactly one element in the domain, aka when $Tu = Tv \implies u = v$.
