## Properties

### A non-surjective map can be made surjective by changing the output space. (intuitive, not in book)

### A map to a larger dimensional space is not surjective (Axler3.24)

> Suppose $V$ and $W$ are finite-dimensional spaces such that
> $\text{dim }V < \text{dim }U$. Then no linear map from $V$ to $W$ is
> surjective.

1.  Intuition

    Surjectivity means that every element in the output space is mapped
    to, and that makes this intuitively true: If the number of possible
    inputs (and by extension, possible outputs) is smaller dimension
    than the output space, how can every output be mapped to?
