* Axler3.30 #def matrix $A_{j,k}$                            :def:
  A $m\time n$ matrix is a rectangle of numbers with $m$ rows and $n$ columns. And other stuff you would expect
* Axler3.32 #def matrix of a linear map, $\mathcal M(T)$                :def:
  #+begin_quote
  Suppose $T \in \mathcal L(V, W)$ and $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ is a basis of $V$ and $w_1, \ldots, w_m$ is a basis of $W$. The /matrix of $T$/ with respect to these bases is the $m\times n$ matrix $\mathcal M\left(\mathcal T, \left(v_1, \ldots, v_n\right), \left(w_1, \ldots, w_m\right)\right)$ whose entries $A_{j,k}$ are defined by
  $$Tv_k = A_{1, k}w_1 + \cdots + A_{m, k}w_m$$.
  #+end_quote
  Note that for each output $Tv_k$ is a linear combination of a column.
* Algebra things
** Axler3.35 #def Matrix Sum                                            :def:
   Pointwise addition, pretty straight forward. *Only works on matrices of the same size!*
** Axler 3.36 The matrix sum of linear maps
   Basically matrices that are linear maps also satisfie additivity of linear maps (Given $S, T \in \mathcal L(V, W), \mathcal M(S) + \mathcal M(T) = \mathcal M(S+T)$)
** Axler3.37 and Axler3.38 (same for scalar multiplication)
   Its the same for scalar multiplication, yay
* Notation Axler3.39 $\mathbb F^{m,n}$                             :notation:
  $F^{m, n}$ is the set of all $m\times n$ matrices with entries in $\mathbb F$.
* Axler3.40 $\text{dim }\mathbb F^{m,n} = mn$
  $\mathbb F^{m,n}$ is itself a vector space with dimension $mn$. (Each basis vector being a matrix with a single one at $i, j$ for each pair of $i, j$)?
* Axler3.44 $A_{j,\cdot}$, $A_{\cdot, k}$
  The dot just means "everything in that row/column".
* Axler3.49 Column of matri product equal matrix times column
  For $m\times n$ matrix $A$ and $n\times p$ matrix $C$, $$(AC)_{\cdot, k} = AC_{\cdot, k}$$.
* And many other ways to think about matrix multplication
