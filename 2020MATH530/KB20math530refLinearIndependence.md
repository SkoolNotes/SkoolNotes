# Overview
## Intuition
- If you have a vector list $v$ that is a linear combination of vectors in $V$, or equivalently,
- $$v = a_1v_1 + ... + a_mv_m \text{where} v_1, ..., v_m \in V$$
- And those choices of $a_1, ..., a_m$ are unique, then this is a linear independence?
## #definition linearly independent
> - A list $v_1, ..., v_m$ of vectors in $V$ is called ***linearly independent*** if the only choice of $a_1, ..., a_m \in F$ that makes $a_1v_1 + ... + a_mv_m$ equal $0$ is $a_1 = ... = a_m = 0$
- ^^^ what the heck is that last part #todo-exr0n
