# Intuition

In a linear map $T : V\to W$, the dimension of the domain $V$ is amount
of stuff that you throw away (null space) **plus** the amount of stuff
that does not get thrown away (the column space). ~~If $T$ is a map from
$V$ to $W$, then the dimension of the source map $V$ is the dimension of
the null space (everything in $V$ that $T$ takes to 0) plus the
dimension of the range (all possible things taken to by $T$)~~
