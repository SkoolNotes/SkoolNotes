## Talking about the reading
### Vector space
#### Operations
- Scalar multiplication
	- Not a multiplication on $V$
	- We need another field of scalars
	- Fundamental difference: **operates on different objects** (only happens on scalar multiplications)
	- Something that's linear means "things work for addition and scalar multiplication"
	- Take $-2x+1y=3$
		- Multiplying by scalars
		- adding them
		- similar to a line in standard form--slope stays constant
	- Take $2x-3y+1z=2$
		- a plane in 3d
- addition
