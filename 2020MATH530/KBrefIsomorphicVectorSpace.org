  An /isomorphism/ is an invertible linear map

* Isomorphic                                                            :def:
  #+begin_quote
  Two vector spaces are called /isomorphic/ if there is an isomorphism from one vector space into the other
  #+end_quote
** intuition
   Can be thought of as relabeling each element $v$ from one space into an element $Tv$ in the other.
** results
*** equal dimension iff isomorphic Axler3.59
    Two vector spaces over some field $\mathbb F$ are isomorphic iff they have the same dimension.
*** $\mathcal L(V, W)$ and $\mathbb F^{m, n}$ are isomorphic
    #+begin_quote
    Given two bases of $V$ and $W$, $\mathcal M$ is an isomorphism between $\mathcal L(V, W)$ and $\mathbb F^{m, n}$
    #+end_quote
*** Axler3.61 $\text{dim } \mathcal L(V, W) = \left(\text{dim } V\right) \left(\text{dim } V\right)$
** intuition
   Not only do two isomorphic spaces have a one to one correspondence between them, that coresspondence is linear which means that they way the elements interact on one side is the same on the other.
