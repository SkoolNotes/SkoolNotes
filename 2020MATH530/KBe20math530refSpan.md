# #definition span
> The set of all linear combinations of a list of vectors $v_1, ..., v_m$ in $V$ is called the span of $v_1, ..., v_m$, denoted $\text{span}(v_1,...,v_m)$:
> $$\text{span}(v_1,...,v_m) = {a_1v_1 + ... + a_mv_m | a_1, ..., a_m \in F}$$
> And the span of an empty list $()$ is ${0}$
