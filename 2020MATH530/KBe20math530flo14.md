- Will present problems from 2.B and/or 2.C next week
- Mini quiz, stop yourself after an hour
- and give your subconscious a chance to think about things

## Polynomials are vectors
	- because you can add and scale them and they are kind of nice in general
## The box under 2.38 
- You can't understand a vector space just by knowing the vectors inside
	- you also need to know the field that you are in
	- See 2.A ex5
- The field that you are over changes your dimension: usually we think of $\mathbb{C}$ as a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$, but in this class we think of it as over $\mathbb{C}$, which means $\text{dim }\mathbb{C} = 1$

## Axler2.41
- It's my question! See [[KBe20math530floQuestions]]

## Axler2.42
- #tip If it's a spanning list that's the right length, then it's a basis and therefore linearly independent.
- If it's a linearly independent list and it's the right length, then it's a basis and therefore spanning.

### An Example
- If you have two planes
