  Let $w \in 
  If $v = 0$ then
$$Tv = 0$$
By Axler 3.11 (Maps take 0 to 0). Thus, $\lambda$ can be anything in $\mathbb F$.
  Otherwise,
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  Tv = w = \left( w \frac{1}{v} \right)v = \lambda v\\
  w\frac{1}{v} = \lambda \in \mathbb F
  \end{aligned}
    $$
  which is in $\mathbb F$ because $w, \frac{1}{v} \in \mathbb F$ and fields are closed under multiplication.
