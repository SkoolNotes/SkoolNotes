## Participation
- Unmute yourself

## Homework Review
- From homework [[20math530retReadingTheTextbook]]

### Is Dot Product Nice?
- Nice = group properties
	- They aren't because its not closed
	- However, we still like dot product because it can easily tell us if the thing is perpendicular

### Inverse of a matrix
- Use 2 systems of equations (2 variables, 2 equations, twice)
![[KBe20math530srcMatrixInverse.png]]
- $y = \frac{c}{bc-ad} = \frac{-c}{ad-bc}$
- Determinant determines whether its possible to have an inverse (because if it's zero, then it's not possible!)
	- A matrix with no inverse is **SINGULAR**
	- Determinant of $A$ is zero
	- A has no inverse

## Proof Attempt Discussion Page?

## Small Groups
1. Calculate cross products
2. Graph cross products
3. Cross Product geometry?
	- It's the perpendicular!
4. Determinant geometric interpretation?
	- It's the perpendicular! IF you crossproduct-ify
	- $\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}\Rightarrow\left|\begin{bmatrix}i&j\\x&y\end{bmatrix}\right| = iy-jx = \begin{bmatrix}y\\-x\end{bmatrix}$
	- $\begin{sketch}$
