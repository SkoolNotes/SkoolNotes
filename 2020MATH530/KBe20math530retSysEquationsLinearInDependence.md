# Prompt
> Which of the following systems have a unique solution? You do NOT have to solve the 3 variable system by hand; you can graph it or use other resources.
> What does this have to do with linearly dependent/independent vectors??

# Ideas
- I first focused on the systems of 2 var 2 equs. I thought of the first set
- $$
\begin{aligned}
2x-3y=1\\
x+3y=3
\end{aligned}
$$
