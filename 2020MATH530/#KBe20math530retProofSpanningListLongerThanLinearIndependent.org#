#+AUTHOR: Exr0n
* Lemma

#+begin_quote
The size of a linearly indpendent set is less than or equal to the size of a spanning set over some vector space $V$.

* Intermediate Result: Span of a linearly independent extension of a linearly independent list has more elements than the span of the original list.
** Lemma
  Given a linearly independent list $v = v_1, \ldots, v_k$ where each vector $v_1, \ldots, v_k \in V$ and another vec
