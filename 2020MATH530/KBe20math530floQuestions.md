# Readings
- Axler 2.A
	- Under "Linear Independence", what is the whole thing about subtracting equations and "if the only way to do this is the obvious way"? pg.32
	- Linear independence feels somewhat okay, but everything past linear dependence lost me.
- Axler 2.C
	- Under example 2.41, near the end, why can't $\text{dim }U$ not equal 4? Why must you be able to expand it by at least one element?
		- Maybe because there are elements in $\mathcal{P}_m(F)$
