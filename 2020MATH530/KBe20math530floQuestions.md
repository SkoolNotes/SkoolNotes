# Readings
- Axler 2.A
	- Under "Linear Independence", what is the whole thing about subtracting equations and "if the only way to do this is the obvious way"? pg.32
	- Linear independence feels somewhat okay, but everything past linear dependence lost me.
- Axler 2.C
	- Under example 2.41, near the end, why can't $\text{dim }U$ not equal 4? Why must you be able to expand it by at least one element?
		- Maybe because there are elements in $\mathcal{P}_m(\mathbb{R})$ that aren't in $U$, so the basis of $U$ must be a different length from the basis of $V$ (else $U$ would equal $V$ and all elements of $V$ would be in $U$ by 2.39)
		- We can shove $f(x) = x$ into the basis of $U$ and it will still be linearly independent (because $f$ was not in $U$), so $\text{dim }U$ must be less than 4.
