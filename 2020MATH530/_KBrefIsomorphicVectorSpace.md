## intuition

Can be thought of as relabeling each element $v$ from one space into an
element $Tv$ in the other.

## results

### equal dimension iff isomorphic Axler3.59

Two vector spaces over some field $\mathbb F$ are isomorphic iff they
have the same dimension.

### $\mathcal L(V, W)$ and $\mathbb F^{m, n}$ are isomorphic

> Given two bases of $V$ and $W$, $\mathcal M$ is an isomorphism between
> $\mathcal L(V, W)$ and $\mathbb F^{m, n}$

### Axler3.61 $\text{dim } \mathcal L(V, W) = \left(\text{dim } V\right) \left(\text{dim } V\right)$

## intuition

Not only do two isomorphic spaces have a one to one correspondence
between them, that coresspondence is linear which means that they way
the elements interact on one side is the same on the other.
