# #definition dimension
> The dimension of $V$ (denoted $\text{dim }V$ is the length of a basis in $V$
- This relies on Axler2.35: Basis length does not depend on the basis
> Any two bases of a finite-dimensional vector space have the same length

## Results
## Axler2.38 Dimension of a subspace
> If $V$ is finite-dimensional and $U$ is a subspace of $V$, then $\text{dim }U \le \text{dim }V$
