** How many solutions $x$ satisfy $Ax=0$?
** When the answer is "infinitely many" what tools might we have to describe the size of that set?
** How many possible outcomes $b$ are there for the equation $Ax=b$ for any $x$.
* in class work! See [[./KBe20math530srcNull_space_and_column_space_intro.pdf]]
** $A=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix}$
*** How many solutions $x$ satisfy $Ax=0$?
    The only solution is x=0, because $Ax = x$.
*** When the answer is "infinitely many" what tools might we have to describe the size of that set?
    N/A
*** How many possible outcomes $b$ are there for the equation $Ax=b$ for any $x$.
    There can be infintely many vaules of $b$..?
** $A=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&1&0\end{pmatrix}$
*** How many solutions $x$ satisfy $Ax=0$?
    Infinitely many (anything of the form $\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\x\end{pmatrix}$)
*** When the answer is "infinitely many" what tools might we have to describe the size of that set?
    A column in the matrix is zero? Maybe the columns are linearly dependent
*** How many possible outcomes $b$ are there for the equation $Ax=b$ for any $x$.
    Infinite with $\text{dim} 2$?
** $A = \begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&1\\0&0\end{pmatrix}$
*** How many solutions $x$ satisfy $Ax=0$?
    Only one value of $x$ makes the product zero.
*** When the answer is "infinitely many" what tools might we have to describe the size of that set?
    n/a
*** How many possible outcomes $b$ are there for the equation $Ax=b$ for any $x$.
    column vector has dimension 3, but the vector space has dim 2
** $A = \begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&0\end{pmatrix}$
*** How many solutions $x$ satisfy $Ax=0$?
    infinite, same vectors as subproblem 2
*** When the answer is "infinitely many" what tools might we have to describe the size of that set?
    dimension 2? column vectors in the matrix are linearly dependent.
*** How many possible outcomes $b$ are there for the equation $Ax=b$ for any $x$.
    infinite, dim 2 (but each vector is dim 3)
** $A = \begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&1&0\end{pmatrix}$
*** How many solutions $x$ satisfy $Ax=0$?
    infinite, vectors of the form $\begin{pmatrix}0\\a\\-a\end{pmatrix}$ (columns linearly dependent)
*** When the answer is "infinitely many" what tools might we have to describe the size of that set?
    dimension 2 subspace of $\mathbb F^3$
*** How many possible outcomes $b$ are there for the equation $Ax=b$ for any $x$.
    infinite, dim2 subspace of $\mathbb F^3$
** $A = \begin{pmatrix}0&0&0\\0&0&3\\0&0&0\end{pmatrix}$
*** How many solutions $x$ satisfy $Ax=0$?
    infinite, vectors of the form $\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\\0\end{pmatrix}$ (columns linearly dependent)
*** When the answer is "infinitely many" what tools might we have to describe the size of that set?
    dim 1 subspace of $\mathbb F^3$
*** How many possible outcomes $b$ are there for the equation $Ax=b$ for any $x$.
