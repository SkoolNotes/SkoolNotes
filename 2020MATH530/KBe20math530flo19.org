* Broader vector spaces
  - Doesn't have to be physics vectors
  - maybe it's like matrices
  - or linear maps themselves
* The Linear Map 0
  A linear map $S = 0$ is a map where $Su = 0 \forall u$.

  Let $w = Tv$.

** If $v = 0$ then
   $$Tv = 0$$
   By Axler 3.11 (Maps take 0 to 0). Thus, $\lambda$ can be anything in $\mathbb F$.

** Otherwise,
   $\frac{1}{v} \in \mathbb F$ because the field has multiplicative inverses for all elements except 0.
   $$
   Tv = w = \left( w \frac{1}{v} \right)v
   $$
   Let $\lambda = w \frac{1}{v}$, then
   $$ \lambda v = w \frac{1}{v} v = w $$
   which is in $\mathbb F$ because $w, \frac{1}{v} \in \mathbb F$ and fields are closed under multiplication.
