   #+begin_quote
   A function $T : V \to W$ is called /injective/ if $Tu = Tv$ implies $u = v$

** Properties
*** A map is injective iff it's null space equals $\{0\}$
*** A map to a smaller dimensional space is not injective (Axler3.23)
    #+begin_quote
    Suppose $V$ and $W$ are finite-dimensional vector spaces such that $\text{dim }V > \text{dim }W$. Then no linear map from $V$ to $W$ is injective.
    #+end_quote
**** Intuition
     That makes sense, because if the output space has a smaller dimension, then there should be two inputs that go to the same output somewhere. Otherwise all the inputs just don't "fit".
** Intuition
   $Tu = Tv \implies u = v$ means that if the outputs are the same, then the inputs are the same, aka only one input goes to that one output. That's why it's called "one-to-one": only one input goes to that one output
