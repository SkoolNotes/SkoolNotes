## Solve Equations

Operation timed out. Arithmetic errors.

## Read 1.B and 1.C
### 1.35 Example
- a) If $b = 0$ then we can divide all $x_3$ by $5$ and combine the last two terms to get $F^3$, which is a vector space, without loss of generality. If not, then when you try to multiply by a scalar then you will find that the above reasoning breaks (i think).
- b) $f(x) = 0$ is continuous, so the additive identity exists. All sums of continuous functions result in continuous functions, so it is closed under addition. And all scalar multiples also work out.
