# See Before: [homogeneous equations](KBrefHomogeneousEquations.org)

# Homogeneous systems of linear equations with more variables than equations has nonzero solutions (Axler3.26)

## Intuition

If you have more variables than equations, then some variables won\'t be
restrained by the equations.

# Inhomogeneous systems of linear equations with more equations than variables have no solution for some choice of constant terms

## Intuition

If you have more equations than variables, then some choice of constant
terms (some set of equations) will be to constraining.

# methodology

Basically turn it into a linear map and then abuse the
injective/surjective theorems
