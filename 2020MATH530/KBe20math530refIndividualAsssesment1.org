* Definitions
** DONE group
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 11:23]
   A set and binary operation that satisfies Group Properties
   - Closed
   - Identity
   - Inverse
   - Associative
** DONE field
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 11:23]
   A set and two binary operations: the primary (addition) and secondary (multiplication) that "mostly" satisfies group properties for both operations, and are *commutative and distributive*.
   It must be a group under the primary operation and a group under the secondary operation except without a secondary inverse for the primary indentity.
** DONE non-singular matrices
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 11:26]
   singular matrix: has no inverse.
   non-singular matrix: has an inverse aka determinant non zero
* Connections
** DONE connect direct sum and linear independence
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 11:28]
   the sum of two spaces is direct if their basises are linearly independent
** TODO matrices to represent complex numbers
* Computation
** DONE Find the determinant of matrices
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 11:59]
   $$\left|\begin{matrix}a&b\\c&d\end{matrix}\right| = ad-bc$$
** DONE compute cross product
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 12:16]
   $$
   \begin{pmatrix}a\\b\\c\end{pmatrix}\times\begin{pmatrix}d\\e\\f\end{pmatrix} = \left|\begin{matrix}i&j&k\\a&b&c\\d&e&f\end{matrix}\right| = i \left|\begin{matrix}b&c\\e&f\end{matrix}\right|+ j\left|\begin{matrix}c&a\\f&d\end{matrix}\right| + k\left|\begin{matrix}a&b\\d&e\end{matrix}\right| = bf-ce, cd-fa, ae - bd
   $$
** TODO Find equations of lines and planes using cross product and dot product
* Derivations
** TODO properties of the determinant
** TODO inverse of a 2x2 matrix
   $$ \begin{bmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}e&f\\g&h\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix} $$
   $$ \begin{aligned} ae+bg = 1\\ ce+dg = 0\\ af+bh = 0\\ cf+dh = 1\\ \end{aligned} $$
   Then you do some algebra to get
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   e = \frac{d}{ad-bc}\\
   g = \frac{-c}{ad-bc}\\
   f = \frac{-b}{ad-bc}\\
   h = \frac{a}{ad-bc}\\
   \end{aligned}
   $$
** TODO rotation matrices

* review quizzes
** DONE first quiz

*** rotation matrices
*** cross product
** DONE mini take home quiz
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 12:04]
   no feedback
** DONE linear independence quiz
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 12:02]
   teacher gave no problems
** DONE quick linear quiz (linear independence and bases)
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 12:01]
   no feedback, I think that quiz was pretty solid..
