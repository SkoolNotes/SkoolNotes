* Definitions
** DONE group
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 11:23]
   A set and binary operation that satisfies Group Properties
   - Closed
   - Identity
   - Inverse
   - Associative
** DONE field
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 11:23]
   A set and two binary operations: the primary (addition) and secondary (multiplication) that "mostly" satisfies group properties for both operations, and are *commutative and distributive*.
   It must be a group under the primary operation and a group under the secondary operation except without a secondary inverse for the primary indentity.
** DONE non-singular matrices
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 11:26]
   singular matrix: has no inverse.
   non-singular matrix: has an inverse aka determinant non zero
* Connections
** DONE connect direct sum and linear independence
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 11:28]
   the sum of two spaces is direct if their basises are linearly independent
** TODO matrices to represent complex numbers
* Computation
** DONE Find the determinant of matrices
   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 11:59]
$$\left|\begin{matrix}a&b\\c&d\end{matrix}\right| = ad-bc$$
** TODO Find equations of lines and planes using cross product and dot product
