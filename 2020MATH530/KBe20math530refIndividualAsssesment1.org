   CLOSED: [2020-10-24 Sat 11:23]
   A set and two binary operations: the primary (addition) and secondary (multiplication) that "mostly" satisfies group properties for both operations, and are *commutative and distributive*.
   It must be a group under the primary operation and a group under the secondary operation except without a secondary inverse for the primary indentity.
