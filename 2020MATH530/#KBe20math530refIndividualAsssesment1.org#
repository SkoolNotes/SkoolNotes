* Definitions
** TODO group
   A set and binary operation that satisfies Group Properties
   - Closed
   - Identity
   - Inverse
   - Associative
** TODO field
   A set and two binary operations: the primary (addition) and secondary (multiplication) that "mostly" satisfies group properties for both operations.
   It must be a group under the primary operation and a group under the secondary operation except without an inverse for the
