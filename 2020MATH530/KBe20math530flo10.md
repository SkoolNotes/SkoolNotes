# Span

## Smallest/largest containing subspaces
- Spans are not the largest vector space that contains the given vectors

- The span of that vector is a line. It's a subspace. But it's not the biggest, because there's also R^2

## Spans tend to be infinite
- Usually a span has infinitely many vectors (unless you're in a weird field (modulo) or have the zero span)
- In the span of just one vector, you can multiply by any scalar which there tends to be infinite of

- The span of that vector is a line. It's a subspace. But it's not the biggest, because there's also R^2
- It only won't be infinite if your span is the span of $()$ (empty list)

## Given a linearly independent set of vectors, would the span equal to the vector space?
- No? It's unclear which vector space is being referred to.

## Span of vectors (example 2.6)
- When it's two vectors, you'd expect the span to be a 2d plane
