* Sum vs Direct Sum
- You can use the fact that when theres *two* subspaces whose intersection is ${0}$.
  - But not when there's more than two subspaces. You have to add two of them into a subspace and then intersect that with the third one.
  - #question : does it work if the all pairwise intersections are zero?
