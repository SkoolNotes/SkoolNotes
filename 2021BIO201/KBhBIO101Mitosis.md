# Mitosis
* Chromesomes line up in equator
* Each chromesome has two chromatid exactly the same
* Microtubials to pull chromesomes appart connected to kinecore, a joint in the chromatid
* Kinetore senses tension, and when it is correct, molecules are sent down the microtubials to send a split signal
