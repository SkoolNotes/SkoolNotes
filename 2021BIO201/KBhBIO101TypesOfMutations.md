# Types of Mutations
## By Place
**Germline mutations** mutate the egg/cell's causes no/local problems but pass the mutated gene down to the children fully through cells.

**Somatic mutations** mutated somatic cell causes local mutations that does not influence much (cancer, but)

### By Method
**Point mutations**

Change one codon on the gene and potentially cause something.

- Slient mutation: has no effect on protein
- Missense: result in amino acid substitution
- Nonsense: substitutes a stop codon for an amino acid

**Indel/Frameshift mutation**

Shift by adding/substracting codons and shift the gene. Everything downstream to the point of mutation will be completely incorrect.

## Mutations in other places
**Promoter/Enhancer mutation**: control the level of expression for genes, which could relate to cancer (over-activation) or a protein deficiency (lack of activation)

**Splice donor and acceptor site mutation**: including extra intron or cutting out required exon

**Ribosome binding sites**: prevents the ribosome from binding

## Large scale DNA changes
Taking whole chunks of DNA or swapping them; usually caused by your DNA wholly breaking (Radioactivity? Incorrectly functioning enzymes?) and then your repair machinary stitching it up wrongly.
