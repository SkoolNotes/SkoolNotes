** Abstract
*** hallmarks include
**** sustaining proliferative signaling
**** evading growth suppressors
**** resisting cell death
**** enabling replicative immortality
**** inducing ingiogenesis
**** activating invasion and metastasis
*** theese hallmarks are newer
**** reprogramming of energy metabolism
**** evading immune destruction
*** underlying
**** genome instability
***** genetic diversity that expedites acquisition of hallmarks
**** inflammation
***** "fosters multiple hallmark functions"
*** TODO why do tumors have "the need ... to acquire the traints that enable them to become tumorigenic and ultimately malignant"? :question:
** Introduction
** section
* Vocab
** TODO neoplastic disease
** ostensibly
*** maybe 'technically'?
** tumor microenvironment
*** presumably inflammation, recruited normal cells, and other stuff that helps the tumor grow
** pathogenisis
*** evolution of 'pathogen' (cancer)
