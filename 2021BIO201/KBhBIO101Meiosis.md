# Meiosis
Meiosis is the process by which sex cells (gametes cells) are produced. These cells have only 23 chromasomes (compared to somatic cell's 23 *pairs*), and they contain a variety of mechanisms for genetic variation.

Meiosis happens in two phases, which happens each in 4 phases:

## Meiosis 1
The purpose of meiosis 1 is to take the 23 _pairs_ of 2-chromatid chomasomes in germline cells (2n diploid, contains two sets of homologous chromosomes) and mix them to separate into two cells containing 23 singular 2-chromatid chromasomes (1n haploid, contains only one set of genes).

- **(P)rophase 1**: the starting cell, a diploid, dissolves its nucleaus and genetic information flows out. Also, [[KBhBIO101GeneticVariation]] by crossing over and independent assortment happens.
- **(M)etaphase 1**: homogous PAIRS of chromosomes (**note!** pairs!!! not the chromasomes) line up along the metaphase plate, forming a double-filed lines
- **(A)naphase 1**: seperate the homologous pairs to the opposite ends of the cell
- **(T)elophase 1**: the two new half-cells proceed to seperate further, creating new nuclear envelopes enveloping the 23-unpaired sister chromatids

## Meiosis 2
The 23 2-chromatid Chromasomes becomes seperated into two more cells each with 23 1-chromatids. This is more similar to a good-ol [[meitos]]

- **(P)rophase 2**: new spindles form, again! and the new haploids' nuclear envelope will start dissoving
- **(P)
