# Meiosis
Meiosis is the process by which sex cells (gametes cells) are produced. These cells have only 23 chromasomes (compared to somatic cell's 23 *pairs*), and they contain a variety of mechanisms for genetic variation.

Meiosis happens in two phases, which happens each in 4 phases:

## Meiosis 1
The purpose of meiosis 1 is to take the 23 _pairs_ of 2-chromatid chomasomes in germline cells (2n diploid, contains two sets of homologous chromosomes) and mix them to separate into two cells containing 23 singular 2-chromatid chromasomes (1n haploid, contains only one set of genes).

- **Prophase 1**: the starting cell, a diploid, dissolves its nucleaus and genetic information flows out. Also, b
- **Metaphase 1**: homogous PAIRS (**note!** pairs!!! not the chromasomes) line up along the metaphase plate, forming a double-filed lines
- **Anaphase 1**: 

## Meiosis 2
The 23 2-chromatid Chromasomes becomes seperated into two more cells each with 23 1-chromatids.
