# Quantum Mechanics
**What is quantum mechanics?**
Quantum => in small/discrete steps

The Quantum of US Currency => $0.01

## Puzzle of the Blackbody Radiation
("black" => opaque): from solid materials, liquids

The radiation from hot, solid materials looks samey (bright yellow) unlike every gas, however, had a spectral emission (think - neon lights.)

But!

The light spectrum did depend on temperature, so what happened? Why is everything hot?

**Max Plank** => trying to model incoming light source from rays as basically all absorbed and not bounced back.

Max Plank's Model 1 in this manner matched well with observations at long wavelengths (red hot). But, it predicted infinite brightness (it will just "keep bouncing") as wavelength => 0, which is wrong. This is the "ultraviolet catastrophie."

So, he made it better.

Max Plank's Model 2 is just Model 1, but an additional assumption that when Energy Transfers from e^- to EMWave, $\delta E$ must be some constant * frequency of light. 

So, to synthesize high frequencies, this cop out had the effect of supressing the infinite growth as $\delta E$ would grow bigger and bigger to the point where all your energy would not go into the EMWave but to this transferring factor.

Which is like... Kind of a cop out. But it did fit medium frequencies better.

***

Einstein => Light != "wave"; instead, light are photon particles moving through space.

**Impontant Knowledges::**

Energy of each photon is equal to the plank constant (h) times the frequency (f). $E = h*f$.

$\lambda * f = c$

$E_{photon} = h \times f$

Instead of Hertz, however, the frequency of F could better be represented with $\omega$, a unit of $\frac{radians}{sec}$ that is derived as $2 \pi f (\frac{radians}{s})$

So to calculate energy with $\omega$, simply use $\bar{h} = \frac{h}{2\pi}$ and so $E = \bar{h}\omega$

## Heisenberg Uncertainty
$\Delta E \times \Delta t = \bar{h}$  => "uncertainty of energy times uncertanity in time is the reduced plank's contstant"

![[Pasted image 20210308111709.png]]

Lifetime of the upper level => $\Delta t$

(Mean) lifetime of the "upper" energy level => $\Delta t$. So, $\Delta E = \frac{\bar{h}}{\Delta t}$.

If $\Delta t$ is small, $\Delta E$ is large.

As long as the units of two deltas end up as $J \times s$, they would be related by the same way with $\bar{h}$

For instance, $\Delta \vec{p} \times \Delta \vec{x} \approx \bar{h}$.

Meaning, in the subatomic world, everything exists based on differening upper-energy-state-time based uncertainties. 

We could see a similar pattern in passing photons through a llit. Slit large, $\Delta P_x small$
