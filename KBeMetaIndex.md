# Howdy

Howdy. I exist to remind @Exr0n how they intended to use Taproot. Feel free to take a look around.

## Naming

Processed files (including notes, annotated documents, anything that was modified) should be named in the format `KBe-{course}-{type}-{title}`:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
`{course}` | The course code | `2020math401`
`{type}` | The file type | (see below )
`{title}` | A descriptive title, almost a set of keywords; **separated by underscores** | `calc_intro`

File `type`s should be one of the following:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
`src` | Any unmodified document designed for static reference, especially handouts and readings.
`flo` | A processed flow of some resource, such as notes from a lecture, a completed worksheet, or annotated reading.
`ref` | A digested, compiled, and consolidated reference focusing on getting the important points across.
`ret` | Something to be exported to the outside world, such as an assignment to be graded.
`index` | The "default" file for any topic. Should link to everything else. **Don't add a `{title}`!**

Don't forget to add a tag demarcating the file type in addition to the type in the name!
