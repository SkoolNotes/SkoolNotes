## Prompt

日本語３ 名前：

悩み相談（なやみそうだん）を書こう！

Now that you've read some advice columns in Japanese and given some advice, it's time to write some of your own! As it says on the bottom of pg. 287 in "Genki 2," imagine you are one of the following people (i.e., NOT yourself) and write a request for help with a problem. Also, write some advice for that problem.

留学生（りゅうがくせい）: studying abroad student
お父さん・お母さん : father / mother
日本語の先生 : japanese teacher
ペット（ねこや犬など）: pet
有名人（ゆうめいじん）: celebrity
その他（others--your choice) 

These do not have to be real problems--you can create something completely fictional and outlandish if you want, but your advice should be reasonable and practical.  Your problem and advice should be about 8-10 sentences total.  For examples of both problems and advice, see pg. 286 of "Genki 2."  Follow the format on pg. 286 and include a title and some identifying information about the writer (i.e., age, gender, location, first name, etc).

Please make a copy of this Google doc and submit it on Canvas.
