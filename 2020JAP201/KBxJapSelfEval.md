```
Please reflect on your learning this past semester in the following areas.  Write a few sentences for each question (#1-3).  You don’t have to answer all the sub-questions; they are just suggestions.  Please answer in English.
```

1) Highlights

One highlight was the oral exam — not the exam itself, but the process of studying for the exam. While incredibly stressful and a massive amount of work, it felt good to finally be able to put everything we have learned this semester to use.


2) Challenges


3) Goals
What were your goals for this semester?  Did you reach them?  What are your goals for next semester?  What topics or skills do you want to focus on next semester?  What are your long-term goals in studying Japanese at Nueva?  How can I help you reach those goals?

4) Do you have any other questions, comments, or requests for me?
