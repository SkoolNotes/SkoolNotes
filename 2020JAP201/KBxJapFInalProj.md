	-   hot springs!
	-   covered in mist
	-   beautiful nature nearby
    
-   Famous places (名所、めいしょ) or products (名物、めいぶつ)
	-   many types of hot springs
	-   amazing park
    
-   What you can see, do, and/or eat there
	-   onsen food
		-   onsen egg
	-   hot springs, of course, but also hot sand baths
    
-   Why you like it or recommend it
	-   hot springs are very cool
	-   food is very good
    
-   Any other “fun facts"
	-   over 100 hot springs!
