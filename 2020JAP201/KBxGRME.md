ミニ作文（さくぶん）

  

Write a mini-essay (5-8 sentences) about your favorite gift that you gave or received on one of the following festive occasions.  What did you give or receive?  Whom did you give it to or receive it from?  Why did you like this gift?  Did you give or receive anything back?  What kind of gift would you like to give or receive in the future?  You don't have to answer all these questions; these are just ideas of things you might write about.  In any case, try to use all three giving and receiving verbs (あげる、くれる、もらう) at least once in your essay.  You could also use ほしい。Remember to use past tense if you're talking about something you gave or received in the past.  がんばって！
