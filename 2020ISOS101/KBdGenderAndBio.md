See [[KBGenderAndBioISOS]] for Huxley's take

# Gist
* Biology is mainly dominated by men
	* Therefore, it is _biased_ towards men
	* "Feminist" hypotheses have been dismissed
	* "Social Sciences" ignored for "not being science"
* Culture has had a large impact on the sciences
	* Critical Theory lmao
* Feminists have tried to reverse this trend
	* Bring attention to the domination of men!
	* Postmodernist feminism: Feelings over facts
		* Ben Shapiro Seething
* Scientific method and procedure are "tainted" with bias and sociological factors
	* Let's not do science anymore :)
	* For and against
		* David Bloor: _Ceteris Paribus_, people favor theories that appeal to them on a sociological level
		* Larry Laudain: There aren't many good theories to choose from and there's good reason to choose one over the other
			* Premise of David Bloor's point is incorrect
			* "Oh, but how are those good theories chosen??"
* We have to be diverse when picking theories and hypotheses or else we won't find change

# Thoughts
* The author frequently makes brash claims about certain real world theories, like female skeletons and brains, but never presents any evidence for those theories.
* Although I could see the intent behind writing this article, I think that it could have been summed up as "Scientific results could be biased because humans find them."
* Cherry-picking evidence? There are many examples of females performing better at certain tasks, but the author never mentions these.
* What is the point anyways? We already established in class that it is impossible to know anything for sure, and therefore science is just a bogus explanation of what we see. It is just as rigorous as religion at explaining the world, because, while it may seem to be more rigorous by using "objective" evidence, all objective evidence is merely information that has been collected and processed subjectively by humans and presented as objective fact. In fact, as we can't prove the existence of anything other than ourselves, we cannot trust other "people" for presenting accurate information. *Science is only useful if we suspend our disbelief and start believing in certain things like objective truth.*

# Discussion Points
* How does this reading tie in with what Socrates had to say?
