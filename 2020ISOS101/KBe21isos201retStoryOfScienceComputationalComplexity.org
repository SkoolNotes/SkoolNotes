* overview
** computational complexity theory studies how "difficult" a problem is
*** importantly, not how "good" an algorithm is... this field deals with all algorithms that solve a given problem
** key concepts
*** types of problems
*** Turing machines
*** reducibility
*** complexity classes
*** hierarchy
** key problems
*** P vs NP
* flows
