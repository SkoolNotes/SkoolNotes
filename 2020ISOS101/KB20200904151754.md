# Notes
 - Two people can study the same thing and come up with different results due to a small difference in procedure
     - This does not mean that any observation is incorrect, but rather that they are making incorrect assumptions based upon them
     - They could also both hold part of the picture without either understanding why both are true
 - Some scientists might even see the same data, but derive different conclusions
 - There is a difference between experiences and physical states
     - People, not their eyeballs see and we can have differences there.
 - In reference to different interpretations of what we see, we have the same visual data that if asked to be reproduced will be roughly the same, but too the observer is interpreted differently
     - Usually context will give us clues as to how to interpret visual data
         - We don't interpret things randomly, but rather with our given context, or in other words our bias
         - Seeing is not the only thing in visual experience as our brain will automatically put our visual input into context and help us understand what we are seeing around us
     - People without context can see, but they can't interpret what the people with context can
