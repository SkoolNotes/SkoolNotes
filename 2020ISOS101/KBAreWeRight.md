# Notes
### Do most people believe in it?
 - There are still scientists that are divided about the issue of climate change, but they are few and far between
	 - The Majority of Americans think that scientists **are** divided about climate change
 - Only a little more than half of Americans think that global temperatures have risen
	 - This is concerning since it is not really a concept that is under heavy scientific debate


### Are we Sure it's Real?
 - Could we be wrong on climate change? We've been wrong in the past even when almost the entire scientific community has a general consensus
 - In the case of climate science since political action is required, there has been an unusual effort to make new scientific discovery about this subject accessible to everyone and not just experts
 - 

## C plus plus that reflects my current feeling on this

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Why does isos post readings so late :(" << std::endl;
}
```
