# Notes
 - There are still scientists that are divided about the issue of climate change, but they are few and far between
	 - The Majority of Americans think that scientists **are** divided about climate change
 - Only a little more than half of Americans think that global temperatures have risen
	 - This is concerning since it is not really a concept that is under heavy scientific debate
 - 

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Why does isos post readings so late :(" << std::endl;
}
```
