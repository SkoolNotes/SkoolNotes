# Gender and the Biological Sciences

* Existance of alternative theory challenges the status quo
* The status quo is the informant of whach questions are asked, what hypotheses are investigated, and which data is ignored
* Accepted theories could be false or "apparently falsified"
* Some hypotheses are designed such that they may be falsified but hard to be proven false
* Feminist empiricism => knower's standpoint is irrelevant and objective methods evalues theories' correctness
* "Standpoint epistemologists" => credentials of knowledge depend on the knower's situations
* Because hypotheses are asked and built upon other agreed upon hypothesis, knowledge exists and are tested in a "branched" structure
    * Impossible to purify theory because theories are all jumped off of a source
    * Hence, scientific method could fail at nodes where theories previously not accepted or explored are not expanded upon
* Could either make decisions blind to the context of theory generation and hence a more restricted hypothesis or to be informed by it
* Bias in theories mode blinded to other possibilities could only be mitigated with a community as a whole
