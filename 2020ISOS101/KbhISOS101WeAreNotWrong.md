* Prominent scientists could be wrong!
	* Consensus formed during the 20th century about a long of scientific discovery, for most thought that the important questions have been answered
	* So, consensus does not mean correctness
* Climate science unusual because of political motivations
* One way to test hypothesis is to do a review of the state of that field
	*  This was originally trivial, but gets much harder nowadays
	*  Too many papers published for one to read efficiently
* Now, Knowledge = Scientific Consensus => only over the simple _realities_ of a hypothesis
	* Claims with scientific consensus are rounded on verified new realities
	* Claims of current causes is not prediction of the future
*
