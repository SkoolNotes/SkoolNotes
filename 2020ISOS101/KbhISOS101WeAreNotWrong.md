* Prominent scientists could be wrong!
	* Consensus formed during the 20th century about a long of scientific discovery, for most thought that the important questions have been answered
	* So, consensus does not mean correctness
* Climate science unusual because of political motivations
* One way to test hypothesis is to do a review of the state of that field
	*  This was originally trivial, but gets much harder nowadays
	*  Too many papers published for one to read efficiently
* Now, Knowledge = Scientific Consensus => only over the simple _realities_ of a hypothesis
	* Claims with scientific consensus are rounded on verified new realities
	* Claims of current causes is not prediction of the future
* So, why do people think that people disagree on scientifically confirm consensus?
	* People are conflating scientific evidence with political decisions
	* Climate science heavily predicated upon future effects, which is not always easy and effective
	* Scientists have sometimes failed to explain themselves beyond their communities	
		* Actually, scientists sometimes thought that the mere worry about dissemination is wasting time
		* "Popularizers" are dismissed
	* Scientists commenting on contested issue often called "politicizing"
	* Organization sometimes propergating alternativg views
	*
