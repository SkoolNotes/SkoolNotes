start of life


modern life


future life





- hard to define life
	- hard to draw the line
	- we are gonna go broad so we don't need to 


starts with the big bang, but we are going to jump pretty far past that

to the early, cooled earth

how did life actully start

couple theories

just gonna go over one

edge of these puddles, stuff like rna

so this rna-like substance would bind, and form it's counterpart, then at low tide it would dissociate

3.8 billion years ago, prokayryotes

3 billion years ago, photosyntesis. evolved indipendantly over fifty times


flash forward to 2.4 billion years ago, cyanobacteria rule the earth and they cause the "great oxidation event"

2 billion years ago, their's the first instance of Eukaryotic cells

530 million years ago, first vertebrate appears

7 million years ago, first "humans" appear
