# $$Robustness,\ Reliabilty,\ Overdetermination$$

Starts with quote about how philosophy should emulate the scientific method. 

This is incorrect. Philosophy is about building a logical framework of understanding. Science is about finding things out about the real world through experimentation. These two subjects and approaches are **fundamentally** incompatible (Godel's theory, perception bias, forgot the name of the theory but extended simulation theory). 

> Our truth is the intersection of independent lies.

This is certainly a thought provoking quote, but once again, I am unsure it is true.  



## Common Features and Concepts of Robustness 

 Robustness analysis
 
Eh, more of the same. 


> ###### With independent alternative ways of deriving a result the result is always surer than its weakest derivation.


All about dealing with fallacies and inconsistency. 

When an error occurs, it corrupts everything it's connected to until you reach something with independent support. 

*Using alternative methods of proving to provide independent support and 'wall off' the spread of inconsistency.*


## Robustness, Objectification, and Realism


Overlap of sensory modalities are what allow us to say an object is robust? ie. not an illusion. 

Rebuts drugs and hallucinigens/natios by saying they arn't consistent across people or time. This is iffy....
