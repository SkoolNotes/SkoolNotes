# $$Robustness,\ Reliabilty,\ Overdetermination$$

Starts with quote about how philosophy should emulate the scientific method. 

This is incorrect. Philosophy is about building a logical framework of understanding. Science is about finding things out about the real world through experimentation. These two subjects and approaches are **fundamentally** incompatible (Godel's theory, perception bias, forgot the name of the theory but extended simulation theory). 

> Our truth is the intersection of independent lies.

This is certainly a thought provoking quote, but once again, I am unsure it is true.
