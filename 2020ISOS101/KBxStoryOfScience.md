## Story of Haber | rough notes

- **Haber invented the Haber-Bosch process, responsible for artificial nitrogen fixation**
- used in fertilizers, incredibly important
	- lack of fixed nitrogen is actually one of the obstacles that origin of life theories hypothesize around
	- N2 makes up around 70% of the air we breath, but is crazy hard to fix into usable nitrogen because of its strong triple bond
- Without the process, a third of the world would be unfed
- Process: ${\displaystyle {\ce {N2 + 3 H2 -> 2 NH3}}\quad \Delta H^{\circ }=-91.8~{\text{kJ/mol}}}$

- **But, Haber was an *evil* guy. **
	- led the German chemical warfare teams in WWI
	
	- He invented poison gas used in world war one
			- And, thus, created Haber's rule:   $c\times t = k$
			- c: concentration, t: time to breath given an effect to produce, k: constant based on the poison itself
		- Also created poisons used in pesticides
		- And created the poison gas the Nazi's used to murder his own relatives
	- Wife committed suicide after a fight with Haber.... 

- **Caused so much pain and suffering, was an evil person. And yet, is responsible for the life of a third of the human race**
	- how do we think about this? how does morality handle a situation like that?
	- dark, but interesting story, interesting context, interesting science!


## Part two! (of part one)

```
Assignment 1b - Research the context and the science: Research and write
some notes/analysis to help you cement your understanding of 

1) the context of the time period, place, and set of people of your moment; 

and 2) the science of your story. Make sure you know the details of the arguments
and claims, for this really makes a good history of science story. Some of
them are absurd; some of them seem absurd, and are genius!
```



### Context
 - **Haber** 
	 - trained as organic chemist
	 - switched to physical chem
		 - mainly industrial processes
	- wrote a book, `Experimental Investigations on the Decomposition and Combustion of Hydrocarbons`
	- also wrote: `The Theoretical Basis of Technical Electrochemistry`
	- worked on nitrobenzeins, the hydrogen oxygen fuel cell, and the glass electrode, then wrote `“The Electrolytic Processes of Organic Chemistry`
	- got intrested in thermodynamics, wrote `The Thermodynamics of Technical Gas Reactions`
	- then he worked on nitrogen fixation! got a nobel for it
- **WWI**
	- entirely devoted research and resources to germany during wartime preparation 
	- nitrates could be used in explosives
	- pioneered chemical warfare, chlorine gas, ect. 
	- became Chief of Germany’s Chemical Warfare Service
	- **General**
		- their was a period of high tension before ww1, eventually set off by the assination of franz ferdinand
		- germany was growing rapidly, caused a security dillema
			- everyone has massive armies sitting and building, which in turn caused others to build armies before wartime
		- in germany, their was a sentiment of wanting to be in the spotlight
		- also, general consensus was that war was inevitable when a state grows, but also good for states. 
		- during the war, trench warfare made poisan gas incredibly effective

### The actual process

- **Overview**
	- using high pressures and catalysts 
	- fixing nitrogen from the air with hydrogen to produce amonia
	- inside container normally made form rthenium or iron
		- temp of >425c, psi > 200
	- converted to fluid ammonia
- **Closer look**
	- ${\displaystyle \ \mathrm {N\_{2}} +3\ \mathrm {H\_{2}} \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad \ 2\ \mathrm {NH\_{3}} \quad \quad {\Delta H=-92.28\;\mathrm {kJ} }\ ({\Delta H\_{298K}=-46.14\;\\mathrm {kJ/mol} })}![{\displaystyle \ \mathrm {N_{2}} +3\ \mathrm {H_{2}} \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad \ 2\ \mathrm {NH_{3}} \quad \quad {\Delta H=-92.28\;\mathrm {kJ} }\ ({\Delta H_{298K}=-46.14\;\mathrm {kJ/mol} })}]$
	- exothermic, of course
	- equilibrium const: ${\displaystyle K_{eq}={\frac {p^{2}\mathrm {(NH_{3})} }{p\mathrm {(N_{2})} \cdot p^{3}\mathrm {(H_{2})} }}}$
