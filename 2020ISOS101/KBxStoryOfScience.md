## Story of Haber | rough notes

- Haber invented the Haber-Bosch process, responsible for artificial nitrogen fixation
- used in fertilizers, incredibly important
	- lack of fixed nitrogen is actually one of the obstacles that origin of life theories hypothesize around
	- N2 makes up around 70% of the air we breath, but is crazy hard to fix into usable nitrogen because of its strong triple bond
- Without the process, a third of the world would be unfed
- Process: ${\displaystyle {\ce {N2 + 3 H2 -> 2 NH3}}\quad \Delta H^{\circ }=-91.8~{\text{kJ/mol}}}$
- But, Haber was an *evil* guy.
