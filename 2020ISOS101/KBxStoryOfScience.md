## Story of Haber | rough notes

- **Haber invented the Haber-Bosch process, responsible for artificial nitrogen fixation**
- used in fertilizers, incredibly important
	- lack of fixed nitrogen is actually one of the obstacles that origin of life theories hypothesize around
	- N2 makes up around 70% of the air we breath, but is crazy hard to fix into usable nitrogen because of its strong triple bond
- Without the process, a third of the world would be unfed
- Process: ${\displaystyle {\ce {N2 + 3 H2 -> 2 NH3}}\quad \Delta H^{\circ }=-91.8~{\text{kJ/mol}}}$

- **But, Haber was an *evil* guy. **
	- led the German chemical warfare teams in WWI
	
	- He invented poison gas used in world war one
			- And, thus, created Haber's rule:   $c\times t = k$
			- c: concentration, t: time to breath given an effect to produce, k: constant based on the poison itself
		- Also created poisons used in pesticides
		- And created the poison gas the Nazi's used to murder his own relatives
	- Wife committed suicide after a fight with Haber.... 

- **Caused so much pain and suffering, was an evil person. And yet, is responsible for the life of a third of the human race**
	- how do we think about this? how does morality handle a situation like that?
	- dark, but interesting story, interesting context, interesting science!


## Part two! (of part one)

```
Assignment 1b - Research the context and the science: Research and write
some notes/analysis to help you cement your understanding of 

1) the context of the time period, place, and set of people of your moment; 

and 2) the science of your story. Make sure you know the details of the arguments
and claims, for this really makes a good history of science story. Some of
them are absurd; some of them seem absurd, and are genius!
```



### Context
 - **Haber** 
	 - trained as organic chemist
	 - switched to physical chem
		 - mainly industrial processesf
