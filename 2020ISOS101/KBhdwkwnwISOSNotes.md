# So, tell me, how do we know? 

So scientists believe that climate change is real, and the American people are misinformed. 

**This reading will ask: "Might the scientific consensus be wrong?"**

Been wrong before, might be wrong again. How do we know? 

## What is consensus and how do we find it?

Interconnection of discoveries, hard for outsiders to understand. 

No consensus on tempo and mode of climate change

## Perceived disagreement  

Uncertainty about the future is conflated with uncertainty about current knowledge 

Lack of communication from scientists
