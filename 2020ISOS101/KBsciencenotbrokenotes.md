Science isnt broken its just low yield

# Discusstion point


The root of this problem, human error and bias, is only becoming magnified as time goes on. As media becomes our main source of truth, and our entertainment becomes media's main source of income, our society as a whole becomes detached from truth. It doesn't necessarily stray away from truth, as the truth becomes entirely irrelevant. The truth becomes irrelevant in the face of the catchy headline, whether or not that headline aligns with the truth. This detachment is not limited to scientific findings, but rather to anything that is supposedly based in truth. We see it in our science, we see it in our entertainment, we see it in our politics, and soon we may see it in our thoughts.
