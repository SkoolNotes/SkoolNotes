# Strong inference notes

#disorganized

* "All science is equal": a fiction
    * Attempt at grant getting?
* "Primary factor in scientific advance is an intellectual one"
    * Fast moving fields have systemic research methods => strong induction, named "strong inference"
    
* String inference
    * Basic inductive reasoning
    * Basis of the scientific method
        1. Hypothesize all alternatives
        2. Devise experiments to rule out hypothesis
        3. Carry out the experiment
        4. Do it again with new subproblem
     * Not as simple as deduction
     * However, minimum sequence for knowledge production
     * Subject to squabbles
         * Whether to exhaust all possbilites or test simply the reasonable ones
         
 * Conditional inductive tree
     1. Possible causes
     2. Crucial experiments
     3. Exclusions based on experimentation and adopting what's left
 
* Molecular biology: user of strong inference


> When we make a single hypothesis, we become attached to it
