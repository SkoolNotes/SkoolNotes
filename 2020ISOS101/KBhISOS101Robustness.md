* Aristotle as seed of idea triangulation
    * The idea of confirming a phenomenon through multiple ways of observation
    * Not a thing that people talk about much, but present in many philosophies
* Robustness Analysis 
    * Based on concept of triangulation
    * Basic steps
         1. Analyze a variety of independent derivations
             * This could mean a lot of things, like
             * 
         3. Look for identical conclusions from these different derivations
         4. Analyze the scope and conditions from which these derivations exist
         5. Analyze any failures of the invariance
     * If, under step 4, there be things that are invariant and within the margin of falure, the analysis is "robust"
