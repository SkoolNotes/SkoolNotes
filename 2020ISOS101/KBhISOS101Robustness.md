# Robustness

#flo #disorganized

* Aristotle as seed of idea triangulation
    * The idea of confirming a phenomenon through multiple ways of observation
    * Not a thing that people talk about much, but present in many philosophies
* Robustness Analysis 
    * Based on concept of triangulation
    * Basic steps
         1. Analyze a variety of independent derivations
             * This could mean a lot of things, like
                 * Different senses of the same thing
                 * Different procidures to sense the same thing
                 * Different assumptions to verify the same thing
                 * Different tests of the same thing
         3. Look for identical conclusions from these different derivations
         4. Analyze the scope and conditions from which these derivations exist
         5. Analyze any failures of the invariance
     * If, under step 4, there be things that are invariant and within the margin of falure, the analysis is "robust" 
 * Common theme across all types of robust analysis
     * Distinction between the material and the unmaterial
