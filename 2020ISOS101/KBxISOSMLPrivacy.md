### Machine learning broad level implications on privacy

- ML requires big data
	- machine learning has driven us into the "information age"
		- cause of most of these issues
	- getting lots of info -> invading privacy, generally
- ML can break privacy without explicit data
	- ML can de-anonymize anonymous activities
		- ML based tracking systems make anonymity hard
- ML can construct human models

### Regulation!

- FTC (federal trade commision) coming down hard
	- hitting facebook, google, ect.
- CCPA, california conumer privacy act
- GDPR, General Data Protection Regulation
