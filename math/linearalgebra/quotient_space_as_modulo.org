A quotient space is similar to a modulo because both take some subpart of the structure and smoosh it to zero.
* looking at V/U
** set of affine subsets ($\{ v+U : v \in V \})
** "modding out by U" (a subspace) means it gets collapsed to zero
*** could just "call the line zero" or carry the entire thing as an element
