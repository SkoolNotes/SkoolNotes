A quotient space is similar to a modulo because both take some subpart of the structure and smoosh it to zero.
* looking at V/U
** set of affine subsets ($\{ v+U : v \in V \})
** "modding out by U" (a subspace) means it gets collapsed to zero
*** could just "call the line zero" or carry the entire thing as an element
*** these are NOT subspaces because most of them don't include zero!
** V/U is isomorphic to the perpendicular line
** if two vetors end up on the same affine subset, then when you subtract them, their difference is an element of U and thus the same as zero
* now looking at modulo
** \mathbb Z % 7 is similar because when you subtract two that end up in the same 'group', the difference is an 'element' of the modulus and the diff is thus zero
** TODO question: can we mod one element in \mathbb R^2 to get the same 'line collapsing' thing?
*** not really, right? because modulo is skippy while space division is a whole space
