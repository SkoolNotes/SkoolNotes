  #+begin_quote
  Suppose $V_1, \ldots, V_m$ are vector spaces over $\mathbb F$
  - The /product/ $V_1 \times \cdots \times V_m = \left\{(v_1, \ldots, v_m) : v_1 \in V_1, \ldots, v_m \in V_m\right\}$
  - Addition on $V_1 \times \cdots \times V_m$ is defined as
	\[ (u_1, \ldots, u_m) + (v_1, \ldots, v_m) = (u_1+v_1, \ldots, u_m+v_m) \]
  - Scalar multiplication on $V_1 \times \cdots \times V_m$ is defined by
	\[ \lambda (v_1, \ldots, v_m) = (\lambda v_1, \ldots, \lambda v_m) \]

** careful
*** product of multiple vector spaces (not just two)
**** similar to how sums/direct sums are not just sums of a pair but rather sums of a list
** properties
*** addition has to be over applicable products
	$v_i \in V_i + u_i \in U_i$ must exist for each $1 \le i \le m$ for the sum $(V_i \times \cdots \times V_m) + (U_i \times \cdots \times U_m)$
** results
*** Axler3.73 product of vector spaces is a vector space
	If vector spaces in a product are over $\mathbb F$, then their product is a vector space over $\mathbb F$.
**** Proof                                                            :proof:
***** commutativity, associativity inherited from $\mathbb F$
***** additive identity, additive inverse, multiplicative identity inherited separataely from each space (they don't interact)
***** distributive should be inherited?
*** Axler3.76 Dimension of a product is the sum of dimensions
	Because you can concatenate the bases from each and fill the others with zero to form the basis of the product
* products of direct sums
** A map $\Gamma : U_1 \times \cdots \times U_m \to U_1 + \cdots + \U_m$ s.t. $\Gamma(u_1, \ldots, u_m) = u_1 + \cdots + u_m$ is surjective by definition, and injective/bijective iff U_1 + \cdots + U_m is a direct sum
   Basically if it is a direct sum, then nothing can interact with eachother and therefore the map will be injective. If it is injective, then nothing interacts and it must be a direct sum.
* A sum is a direct sum iff the dimensions add up
** A sum $U_1 + \cdots + U_m$ is a direct sum iff $\text{dim} (U_1 + \cdots + U_m) == \text{dim} U_1 + \cdots + \text{dim} U_m$
