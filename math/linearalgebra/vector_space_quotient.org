* sum of a vector and a subspace                                        :def:
** for $v \in V$ and $U \subset V$, $v+U = \{ v+u : u \in U\}$ (aka shift everything by $v$)
* affine subset, parallel                                               :def:
** an affine subset of $V$ is a subset of $V$ that is "shifted" by a vector in $V$
** all affine subsets from a subspace are said to be parallel to that subspace
* quotient space                                                        :def:
** A quotient space $V/U$ where $U \subset V$ is the set of affine subsets parallel to $U$ (all shifts)
** result
*** two affine subsets parallel to $U$ are equal or disjoint (Axler3.85)
**** intuition
***** if they are 'parallel', then they must be equal (inf intersection) or disjoint (zero intersection)
*** the quotient space is a vector space
*** quotient map, $\pi$                                                 :def:
**** The quotient map $\pi : V \to V/U$ is defined by $\pi(v)=v+U \forall v$
**** basically it gives a quotient space from a vector (syntactic sugar)
*** dimension of a quotient space
**** $\text{dim}V/U = \text{dim} V - \text{dim} U$
* squiggle $T$ (the condensed map)
** $Tsquiggle : V/(\text{null}T) \to W$ s.t. $Tsquiggle(v+\text{null T}) = Tv$
