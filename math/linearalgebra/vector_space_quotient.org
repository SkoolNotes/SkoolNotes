* sum of a vector and a subspace                                        :def:
** for $v \in V$ and $U \subset V$, $v+U = \{ v+u : u \in U\}$ (aka shift everything by $v$)
* affine subset, parallel
** an affine subset of $V$ is a subset of $V$ that is "shifted" by a vector in $V$
** all affine subsets from a subspace are said to be parallel to that subspace
