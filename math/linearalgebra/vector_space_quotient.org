* sum of a vector and a subspace                                        :def:
** for $v \in V$ and $U \subset V$, $v+U = \{ v+u : u \in U\}$ (aka shift everything by $v$)
* affine subset, parallel                                               :def:
** an affine subset of $V$ is a subset of $V$ that is "shifted" by a vector in $V$
** all affine subsets from a subspace are said to be parallel to that subspace
* quotient space                                                        :def:
** A quotient space $V/U$ where $U \subset V$ is the set of affine subsets parallel to $U$ (all shifts)
