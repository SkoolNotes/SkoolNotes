  Suppose $V_1, \ldots, V_m$ are vector spaces over $\mathbb F$
  - The /product/ $V_1 \times \cdots \times V_m = \left\{(v_1, \ldots, v_m) : v_1 \in V_1, \ldots, v_m \in V_m\right\}$
  - Addition on $V_1 \times \cdots \times V_m$ is defined as
	\[ (u_1, \ldots, u_m) + (v_1, \ldots, v_m) = (u_1+v_1, \ldots, u_m+v_m) \]
  - Scalar multiplication on $V_1 \times \cdots \times V_m$ is defined by
	\[ \lambda (v_1, \ldots, v_m) = (\lambda v_1, \ldots, \lambda v_m) \]

** careful
*** product of multiple vector spaces (not just two)
**** similar to how sums/direct sums are not just sums of a pair but rather sums of a list
** properties
*** addition has to be over applicable products
	$v_i \in V_i + u_i \in U_
