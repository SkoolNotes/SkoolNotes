# Time Constant with Various Components

Most of the analysis for data collected as a class was done on the "charge rate constant" (`time/RC`) of each circuit, defined as:
$$
\frac{t}{RC}
$$

`time/RC` is a unitless scalar that represents how quickly it takes to charge any capacitor for a given voltage. Because voltage data was not collected during the experiment
