# Silicon
- Integrated circuits changed computer circutries
- Circuts's sillicon purified as polycillion chunks
	- The cubic seed will form a new cubic sillicon
	- Impurities added to sillicon to cause it to conduct
	- Negative charged free carrier (asinic) => n type
	- Positive charged carrier  (boron) => p type
- Christle ground to form ingots
- Then, sliced thin as wafers
- Wafers are then ground thin + removed of surface contaminates
- Then, wafers are checked for resistivity

-   CMOS
	-  n-type transitior sandwich a p type region
	-  A charge on the gate wolud cause the charge to go through from source => drain
	- Vise, versa
- Meaning, when the P-N circut combinations are on, the N-P combination is off   
- High temperature used to grow sillicon dioxide to protect the sillicon as sillicon interacts with pure exygen
- Photoresist smeared on the wafer, and light is exposed to each part to etch patters
- Then, lazers/plasma/acid guides etching of the wafer suface
- Plasma implimant impurities to cause
- Photoresist then washed off
- The wafer is then cleaned off
