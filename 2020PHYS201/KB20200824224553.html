            <h1 id="lets-talk-about-gravitational-fields">Let’s talk about Gravitational Fields</h1>
            <p>Each object has what’s called <strong>gravitational field.</strong> Surrounding each object has what is effectively many tiny vectors getting weaker and weaker as you move away from the Earth.</p>
            <p>Remember, this is <em>not the gravitational force</em> between two objects. This is simply the <em>gravitational FIELD</em> of one. To calculate the force of gravity from the Gravitational Field, simply use multiply the mass of the attractee to the gravitational field of the attractor, that is, <span class="math inline">\(F_{grav} = M_{obj2} * GravField_{obj1}\)</span>.</p>
            <h2 id="newtons-law-of-gravitation">Newton’s Law of Gravitation</h2>
            <p>And for actually calculating the gravitational field, you will need</p>
            <p>For good measure, here’s the two equations combined to form the full gravitational field.</p>
            <p>It does not actually matter which object is the target and which one is the source. Because of an magical property called the “Multiplication is Commutative”, swapping attractor and attractee will have the same numerical result for gravitational force. (<em>note! the field vectors are still different though</em>)</p>
            <p>The units for <em>Gravitational Field</em> is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{N}{kg}\)</span>, which, the keen-eyed will see, equals <span class="math inline">\(\frac{m}{s^2}\)</span>, which, of course, is acceleration.</p>
            <p>And now for a old piece of news:</p>
            <h2 id="electric-field-striketh-back">Electric Field Striketh Back</h2>
            <p>You will notice that the <em>Electric Field</em> works very similarly to the <em>Gravitational Field</em></p>
            <p>To recall, Coulomb’s Law looks like <span class="math inline">\(F_{attraction} = k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{R^2}\)</span>, which is eerily similar to the Force of Gravity, <span class="math inline">\(F_{grav} = G\frac{M_2M_2}{R^2}\)</span>.</p>
            <p>And so, by the some token, we could also redefined electric force as:</p>
            <p>Unsurprisingly, the units for <em>Electric Field</em> is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{N}{C}\)</span>, and no, before you get excited, there is nothing it equals.</p>
