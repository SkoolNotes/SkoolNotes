* Silicon
** refirenry
*** from sand
*** melted
*** small molten crystal "seed" lower into a vat
*** crystal forms
*** pull cylander from molten reigon
** structure
*** cubic atomic structure
*** 4 electrons valence shell
*** perfect crystal will have no holes
*** but at room temperature, free electrons can conduct
** impurities called dopants
*** negative
**** arsenic or phospherus
**** one more valence
**** n type crystal because negative free carriers
*** positive
**** boron
**** missing electron acts like positive carrier, "hole"
