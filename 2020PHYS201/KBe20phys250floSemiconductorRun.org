* Silicon
** refirenry
*** from sand
*** melted
*** small molten crystal "seed" lower into a vat
*** crystal forms
*** pull cylander from molten reigon
*** ground to form ingots
*** sawed with diamond blade to form wafers
*** wafer scrubbed
*** edges rounded and surfaces ground smooth and to create uniform thickness
*** rinsed and etched in "chemicals" to remove impurities
*** final polish on one side of the wafer
*** all so that there are no scratches or contamination
*** then, measured for resistivity
**** function of dopant concentratian
*** electron beam machine
**** etches patterns onto chrome plated glass plates
** design
*** circuit design
*** organization of design team
**** based on organization of the chip
**** establish microarchitecture that regulates sequences and timings
**** design divided into areas
***** each unit given to logic designer
***** each functional block given to circuit designer who works at transistor level
**** mask designer draws out blueprints on paper
*** transistors
**** represents digital zero or one
**** C-MOS transistors
***** complementary metal oxidized transistor
***** n type transistor
****** surrounded by n-type
****** sandwhiching a p-type layer
****** gate electrode is near but not connect to the p type reigon
****** a positive charge in gate attracts electrons and allows electrons to pass
***** both types can be made on the same chip using "complementary manufacturing?"
***** signals propogate through complex maze of switches
** structure
*** cubic atomic structure
*** 4 electrons valence shell
*** perfect crystal will have no holes
*** but at room temperature, free electrons can conduct
** impurities called dopants
*** negative
**** arsenic or phospherus
**** one more valence
**** n type crystal because negative free carriers
*** positive
**** boron
**** missing electron acts like positive carrier, "hole"
*** silicon can be either good or poor conductor (semiconductor)
**** controlled by concentration of dopant
