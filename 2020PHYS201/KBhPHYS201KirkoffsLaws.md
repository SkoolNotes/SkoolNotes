#### Kirkoff's First Law
**Sum of voltage in any closed loop should add up to 0**

As in, the sum of all voltage changes from Start => Start will add up to 0.

#### Kirkoff's Second law
**Net current flowing into a node is 0**

With a current $i_0$, when it flows into a junction like B, the current $i_0$ splits into $i_2$ and $i_3$

So, to calculate the resistance and current at every point o
 
 START at start
 
 * $+12$
 * $-I_1*10$ (per $I = \frac{\Delta V}{resistance}$)
 * $-I_2 * 20$
 * $-I_1 * 15$
 * $= 0$

$I_1 - I_2 - I_3 = 0$, per Kirerbab's Second Law.
