# Coulomb's Law

![Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 7.40.48 PM.png](./Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 7.40.48 PM.png)

* Electrical forces gets stronger as charge increases
* Electrical forces gets weaker as charge decreases

> The magnitude of force that a particle, $q1$, has upon another $q2$, is given by the Coulumb's law

\definition[where $k$, a constant for change, $q_1$, change of first particle, $q_2$, change of second partical, $r^2$, distance squared]{Coulumb's Law}{$k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$}

Note! The Standard Unit of Charge (Q) is the Coulomb — a representation for change for many electrons or many protons

**Remember this!**

\definition{Charge of an Electron}{$-1.602 \times 10^{-19} Q$}

\definition{k}{$8.99 \times 10^9 \frac{Nm^2}{Q^2}$}

> E.M. forces, really, are two forces interacting with each other

**Notice! Be careful with the signs when applying coulumbs law**

* If resulting Coulomb force > 0, force is REPULSIVE (became you multiplied positive to positive or negative negative)
* If resulting Coulomb force < 0, force is ATTRACTIVE (became you multiplied positive to negative)

Coloumb's law could be applied when modeling [[KBhPHYS201ElectricFields]] Electric fields to see how particles interact and how they influence each other.

## Guided Problem Solve

Special care must be taken for solving these problems w.r.t. to both vector direction and multiple-atom-interactions [[KBhPHYS201GuidedProblemCoulomb]]


## Here's something! DNA Replication

The question is… Between these four atoms, _how many do we need to calculate to find if these two repel or attract?_

This is fairly simple. Because of the fact every force between each pair of atoms between these two elements needs to be calculated. So… 2 (on the left) times 2 (on the right) = 4.

If these repel, the don't combine. If they attract, of course they do.
