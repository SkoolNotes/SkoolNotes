            <p><strong>Notice! This one is a little different because there are three charges.</strong></p>
            <p>We could see that, because of the fact that <span class="math inline">\(Q_2\)</span> is closer to <span class="math inline">\(Q3\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(Q1\)</span> is and the two particles are pulling in different directions, we could infer that <span class="math inline">\(||F_{32}||\)</span> is larger then <span class="math inline">\(||F_{31}||\)</span>. Because of this, we could find that <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span> will have a net force “to the left” — in <span class="math inline">\(F_{32}\)</span>’s direction.</p>
            <p>And, because of that, we know that <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span> will be accelerating towards the left. But <strong>Notice</strong>!, whenever <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span> moves towards the left, the distances between the particles changed, meaning the force acting upon <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span> changes! Meaning, <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span>’s acceleration “to the left” is not constant. Unfortunately, then, no equation of kinematics for us :(.</p>

            <p>The question is… Between these four atoms, <em>how many do we need to calculate to find if these two repel or attract?</em></p>
            <p>This is fairly simple. Because of the fact every force between each pair of atoms between these two elements needs to be calculated. So… 2 (on the left) times 2 (on the right) = 4.</p>
            <p>If these repel, the don’t combine. If they attract, of course they do.</p>
            <h1 id="gravity">Gravity!</h1>
            <p>Each object has what’s called <strong>gravitational field.</strong> Surrounding each object has what is effectively many tiny vectors getting weaker and weaker as you move away from the Earth. You could calculate the force of gravity just by knowing…</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>The mass of what you are calculating.</li>
            <li>How far away is the other object’s mass.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Then, out pops a value that tells you the magnitude of force that an object would exert on another object w.r.t. their mass that was dropped right where that vector was.</p>
            <p>Remember, this is <em>not the gravitational force</em> between two objects. This is simply the <em>gravitational FIELD</em> of one. To calculate the force of gravity, simply use multiply the mass of the attractee to the gravitational field of the attractor, that is, <span class="math inline">\(F_{grav} = M_{obj2} * GravField_{obj1}\)</span>.</p>
            <h2 id="newtons-law-of-gravitation">Newton’s Law of Gravitation</h2>
            <p>And for actually calculating the gravitational field, you will need</p>
            <p>For good measure, here’s the two equations combined to form the full gravitational field.</p>
            <p>It does not actually matter which object is the target and which one is the source. Because of an magical property called the “Multiplication is Commutative”, swapping attractor and attractee will have the same numerical result for gravitational force. (<em>note! the field vectors are still different though</em>)</p>
            <p>The units for <em>Gravitational Field</em> is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{N}{kg}\)</span>, which, the keen-eyed will see, equals <span class="math inline">\(\frac{m}{s^2}\)</span>, which, of course, is acceleration.</p>
            <p>And now for a old piece of news:</p>
            <h2 id="electric-field-striketh-back">Electric Field Striketh Back</h2>
            <p>You will notice that the <em>Electric Field</em> works very similarly to the <em>Gravitational Field</em></p>
            <p>To recall, Coulomb’s Law looks like <span class="math inline">\(F_{attraction} = k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{R^2}\)</span>, which is eerily similar to the Force of Gravity, <span class="math inline">\(F_{grav} = G\frac{M_2M_2}{R^2}\)</span>.</p>
            <p>And so, by the some token, we could also redefined electric force as:</p>
            <p>Unsurprisingly, the units for <em>Electric Field</em> is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{N}{C}\)</span>, and no, before you get excited, there is nothing it equals.</p>
            <h1 id="electric-fields">Electric Fields</h1>
            <p>With masses, it’s easy. Masses always <em>attracts</em> because negative mass doesn’t exist (<em>yet</em>). But, with electric field, figuring out directions is harder.</p>
            <p>So, we have two choices to dealing with directions:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>Electric field of any <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> has two values, one “attract field” and one “repel field”</li>
            <li>Drawing a single vector <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span>, but remember that the direction of the vector depends on what’s dropped in it</li>
            </ol>
            <p>USE OPTION <strong>2</strong>.</p>
            <p>In this manner, when we say, “this atom has a electric field vector in this direction”, we mean two things</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>When a positive test change is dropped onto that vector, it will experience force in the same direction as the vector</li>
            <li>When a negative "" "" "“,”" "" "" the opposite direction as the vector</li>
            </ol>
            <h2 id="illustrating-electric-fields">Illustrating Electric Fields</h2>
            <p>Yes, you could do this.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>And theoretically draw infinite metric tonnes of these around an object. But that’s inefficient. We could instead think about electric fields as infinitely expanding in lines that travel from the center of the object outwards:</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="/Users/houliu/Documents/School%20Work/2020-2021/KnowledgeBase/2020PHYS201/Screen%20Shot%202020-08-24%20at%208.57.21%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 8.57.21 PM.png" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 8.57.21 PM.png</figcaption>

            <p>Well, here’s a problem. This diagram does not show the magnitude of the charge.</p>
            <p>Well, fear not! Notice that there are shaded circles behind the red arrows? The density of these circles dictate the magnitude of the charge — the denser the circles, the higher the magnitude.</p>
            <h2 id="and-now-lots-of-these">And now, lot’s of these</h2>
            <p>Imagine if we had… Well… Lot’s of these:</p>

            </figure>
            <p>In this diagram, A + B are both positive. The diagram, now, shows <em>both</em> electric field vectors for A and B. Take, for instance,</p>
            <p>This tidbit: <img src="/Users/houliu/Documents/School%20Work/2020-2021/KnowledgeBase/2020PHYS201/Screen%20Shot%202020-08-24%20at%209.04.52%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.04.52 PM.png" /></p>
            <p>If we connected it back to A and B, you will get:</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="/Users/houliu/Documents/School%20Work/2020-2021/KnowledgeBase/2020PHYS201/Screen%20Shot%202020-08-24%20at%209.05.26%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.05.26 PM.png" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.05.26 PM.png</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>As you could see, the force from B is smaller because the point is farther away from B.</p>
            <p>Ok, now, let’s see the <em>net</em> electric field by adding all of these vectors up:</p>
            <figure>

            <p>Nice! You are, at this point, hopefully seeing something of a symmetry. Remember how we had two ways of drawing an electric field? That</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>You choose to draw an infinite amount of vectors, or</li>
            <li>You draw lines from the center of each element outwards, connecting all the vectors</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If we do option 2, you see this lovely image:</p>
            <figure>

            <p>Please, be also reminded of the fact that the world is 3D, making the diagram more like this:</p>

            <p>Great. Lastly there are other possible configurations of charges apart from positive-positive, and they are as follows:</p>

            <p>As you could see. There is a lovely point (yes, it’s actually a point, but people are lazy and don’t to draw, say <em>infinite</em> field lines) in the middle of Neg-Neg and Pos-Pos electric field graphs with a lovely hole. At that hole, the field value is 0.</p>

            <p>As you could see, the higher amount of field lines, the higher is the strengths. If each charge’s field “bends” towards the other, (i.e. particles that go <em>AAAAA I AM GOING TO OVERTAKE THE OTHER PARTICLE’S FIELD LINES</em>)</p>

            <p>If the charges on a conductor are stationary…</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>E-field <em>in</em> the conducting material must be zero
            <ul>
            <li>Because, uhh…., the conductor is stationary, meaning no electron flow</li>
            <li>So, without electric flow, you know that there is no motivation for electrons to flow, which means no electric field</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>At the surface of the conductor, if any E-field is present, it must be perpendicular to the surface
            <ul>
            <li>If you have a horizontal component, the conductor would be, well, <em>conducing</em> electricity, making it rather not static</li>
            <li>If the E-Field is perpendicular, because we are in the Physics Vacuum, no charges will flow because it can’t flow out of the conductor into something else</li>
            </ul></li>
            </ol>

            <p>Take, a neutral conductor.!</p>

            <p>At the point of the cursor, there would be an electric field cause by the central charge going outwards; at which point the following will happen…</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>The red (positive) charge attracts electrons to the inside of the tube</li>
            <li>These newly electrons set up their own electric fields equal and opposite to the electric field by the central electron (because of the Electric Field Deux. Gravitational Field thing)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>So, the conductor has a net electric field of 0. It’s static.</p>
            <p>Because of the fact that the neutral conductor had both 1) and 2) going on, there is no tangent changes to the conductor (<strong>think!</strong> rule 2 aforementioned), and only field lines that are perpendicular (emitted by the red, positive charge), will be passed out.</p>
