With masses (and w.r.t. [[KB20200824224553]] gravitational fields), it's easy. Masses always *attracts* because negative mass doesn't exist (_yet_). But, with an electric field,  figuring out directions is harder.

So, we have two choices to dealing with directions:

1) Electric field of any $Q$ has two values, one "attract field" and one "repel field"
2) Drawing a single vector $\vec{E}$, but remember that the direction of the vector depends on what's dropped in it

USE OPTION **2**.

In this manner, when we say, "this atom has a electric field vector in this direction", we mean two things

1. When a positive test change is dropped onto that vector, it will experience force in the same direction as the vector
2. When a negative "" "" "", "" "" "" the opposite direction as the vector

## Illustrating Electric Fields

There are two ways of illustrating electric fields — either drawing an infinite amount of vectors (that's a lot of vectors), or drawing lines originating from the main particle lining up all the vectors (think! original Japanese flags.)

See [[KB20200824225536]] illustrating electric fields.

## Conductors and Electric field

If the charges on a conductor are stationary…

1) E-field _in_ the conducting material must be zero
   * Because, uhh...., the conductor is stationary, meaning no electron flow
   * So, without electric flow, you know that there is no motivation for electrons to flow, which means no electric field
2) At the surface of the conductor, if any E-field is present, it must be perpendicular to the surface
    * If you have a horizontal component, the conductor would be, well, _conducing_ electricity, making it rather not static
    * If the E-Field is perpendicular, because we are in the Physics Vacuum, no charges will flow because it can't flow out of the conductor into something else
    
### An now, something interesting
Take, a neutral conductor.!

At the point of the cursor, there would be an electric field cause by the central charge going outwards; at which point the following will happen…

1) The red (positive) charge attracts electrons to the inside of the tube
2) These newly electrons set up their own electric fields equal and opposite to the electric field by the central electron (because of the Electric Field Deux. Gravitational Field thing)

So, the conductor has a net electric field of 0. It's static.

Because of the fact that the neutral conductor had both 1) and 2) going on, there is no tangent changes to the conductor (**think!** rule 2 aforementioned), and only field lines that are perpendicular (emitted by the red, positive charge), will be passed out.
