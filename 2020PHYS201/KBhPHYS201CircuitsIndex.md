# Circuits
## First, some key vocab:
### Current
Current is a measure for the flow of electrons. Think about it as "how much water goes through this arbitrary box on this river per second".

See [[KBhPHYS201Current]]

### Resistance
Resistance is a measure of the pushback of current.

* Multiples battries can't be solved with the combined resistor method
* So, first guess the current flow
    * Each batteries' current will flow back to itself
    * When currents meet, they will combine
* Use currents identified before + Kirkoff's second law
* Use Kirkoff's first law to find loops (and hence equations) that, together, **covers all components**
* If resulting currents is negative, that means that you drew the current in the wrong direction, or you are charging a battery
    * Either way, if the signs are preserved to solve the rest of the equation, you should be fine numerically
    * Just update your graph to reflect the actual currents' directions
