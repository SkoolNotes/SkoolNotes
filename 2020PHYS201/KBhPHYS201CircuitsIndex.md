# Circuits

In them, flows [[KBhPHYS201Resistance]] Resistance and Current

#disorganized, and split [[KBhPHYS201Resistance]] Resistance and Current

* Multiples battries can't be solved with the combined resistor method
* So, first guess the current flow
    * Each batteries' current will flow back to itself
    * When currents meet, they will combine
* Use currents identified before + Kirkoff's second law
* Use Kirkoff's first law to find loops (and hence equations) that, in total, covers all components
* If resulting currents is negative,
