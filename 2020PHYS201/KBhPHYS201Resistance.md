# Resistance and Current

Resistance roughly measures how much pressure against current — electron flow there is in a conductor.

## Current
Use the variable $I$, a unit $\frac{C}{s}$, $Amps$, to measure current. This also equals $\frac{\Delta V}{Resistance}$. Big resistance, little current. Current is measured in a unit $\frac{C}{s}$, which intuitively makes sense — Current/second is kind of like metres/second — it measures, roughly, the "speed" at which electrons flow.

\definition{Current $I$}{A value measured in unit $\frac{C}{s}$, a.k.a. $Amps$ that measures electron flow}

## Resistance
So, let's figure out resistance.

<<<<<<< HEAD
We know that...  $V$ = $\frac{J}{C}$, per [[KBhPHYS201Voltage]], and we also know that resistance would equal a unit $\frac{Vs}{c}$ given that $I = \frac{C}{s} = \frac{\Delta V}{Resistance}$. Plugging in the definition of voltage, we get that resistance is measured in $\frac{Js}{C^2}$. We call this unit Ohms, or $\Omega$.

\definition{Resistance $\Omega$}{A value measured in $\frac{Js}{C^2}$ that measures the resistance to current}

### Calculating resistance
* So, let's think. With a wire of length L and with a wire of area A, if we increase L, the resistance in the wire would increase; if we increase area A, the resistance in the the wire would decrease.
* $Resistance = \frac{L}{A}*ResistivityOfMaterial$ with units $\frac{m}{m^2}(\Omega \times m)$.

and, indeed, resistivity of materials are measured in $\Omega \times m$, which also makes sense intuitively.
