# Resistance and Current

Resistance roughly measures how much pressure against current â€” electron flow there is in a conductor.

* Use the variable $I$, a unit Coulombs/Second, to measure current. This also equals $\frac{\Delta V}{Resistance}$. Big resistance, little current.
* So let's figure out resistance
    * $V$ = $\frac{J}{C}$
    * Resistance = $\Omega$ = $\frac{\Delta V}{I}$ = $\frac{Js}{C^2}$
* $I$ = $\frac{C}{s}$ = Amps 
* Calculating resistance
    * So, let's think. With a wire of length L and with a wire of area A, if we increase L, the resistance in the wire would increase; if we increase area A, the resistance in the the wire would decrease.
    * $Resistance = \frac{L}{A}*ResistivityOfMaterial$ with units $\frac{m}{m^2} * (\Omega * m)$.
