# Resistance
So, let's figure out resistance.

We know that...  $V$ = $\frac{J}{C}$, per [[KBhPHYS201Voltage]], and we also know that resistance would equal a unit $\frac{Vs}{c}$ given that $I = \frac{C}{s} = \frac{\Delta V}{Resistance}$ (see [[KBhPHYS201Current]] Current). Plugging in the definition of voltage, we get that resistance is measured in $\frac{Js}{C^2}$. We call this unit Ohms, or $\Omega$.

\definition{Resistance $\Omega$}{A value measured in $\frac{Js}{C^2}$ that measures the resistance to current}

### Calculating resistance
* So, let's think. With a wire of length L and with a wire of area A, if we increase L, the resistance in the wire would increase; if we increase area A, the resistance in the the wire would decrease.
* $Resistance = \frac{L}{A}*ResistivityOfMaterial$ with units $\frac{m}{m^2}(\Omega \times m)$.
    
and, indeed, resistivity of materials are measured in $\Omega \times m$, which also makes sense intuitively.
