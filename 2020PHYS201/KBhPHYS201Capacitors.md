# Capacitors
## Capacitors vs. Batteries
**Batteries** => Converting $PE_{chem}$ => Eletrical energy

**Capacitors** => Converting $PE_{elec}$ => Eletrical energy

When you are discharging a battery, they remain at constant voltage until they are used up, at which point the voltage drop like a plate.
 
When you are

Charge remaining: capacitance times voltage
