# Capacitors
## Capacitors vs. Batteries
**Batteries** => Converting $PE_{chem}$ => Eletrical energy

**Capacitors** => Converting $PE_{elec}$ => Eletrical energy

When you are discharging a battery, they remain at constant voltage until they are used up, at which point the voltage drop like a plate.
 
When you are discharging a capacitor, there is a linear fall in voltage that is constant.

Charge remaining: capacitance times voltage

## Energy on a Capacitor
Energy stored on a capacitor: $E=\frac{V_c * Q}{2}$.

Charge on a capacitor: $Q = C \times V_c$

Farads: $F = \frac{C}{V}$

So, putting this together, the energy stored on a capacitor would be...

\definition{Energy stored in a capacitor}{$E=\frac{V \times Q}{2} = }
