# Electrostatics

## Conduction vs Insulation
- Charge can flow through or over the surface of conductors:
	- Metals, graphite, plasma
- Insulators do not allow charge to flow along or through them.

## Transferred and Induced Charges
- Charge can jump from a charged object to an uncharged object, sometimes through insulators depending on voltage.
- A charged object can induce a temporary charge **migration** in an uncharged object, but the entire object is still neutral.

## Coulomb's Law
$F\vec{F} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\left(\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}\right) = k\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$

$k = 8.99_{x10^5} \frac{N m^2}{C^2}$

| Variable | Units | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
$q_1$, $q_2$ | Coulomb ($C$) | The charge of each particle 
$r$ | Meters ($m$) | Distance between centers of charges

$\epsilon_0$ and $k$ are different ways of representing the constant.
