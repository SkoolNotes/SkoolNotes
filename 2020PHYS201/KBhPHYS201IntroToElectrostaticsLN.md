First, let's begin with...

# Electrostatics Cheat Sheet
[[KB20200825215200]]

# An atom
We begin by recognizing the fact that **it's the electron that can move around in an atom.**.

For now, materials could be either **Conductors** or **Insulators.**

* **Conductors**
    * $e^-$ move freely
    * Think! Metal
* **Insulators**
    * $e^-$ cannot move freely
    * Think! Wood/Glass/Plastic

Objects have different charge properties [[KBhPHYS201AtomChargeProps]], and they interact with each other in specific ways:

* **Like changes tend to repel**
* **Different changes tend to attract**  

[[KBhPHYS201AtomInteractions]]

### The Rods and Paper Experiment

Recall the day one at-home experiment [[KBhPHYS201D1AtHomeActivity]]. Let's see how the interactions we saw relates to the physical world:

See [[KBhPHYS201ElectrostaticPolarization]], the analysis of the Rods and Paper Experiment

### The Electroscope

See [[KBhPHYS201Electroscope]], the electroscope.

# Gravity + Gravitational Fields!

Each object has what's called **gravitational field.** Surrounding each object has what is effectively many tiny vectors getting weaker and weaker as you move away from the Earth. You could calculate the force of gravity just by knowing…

1. The mass of what you are calculating.
2. How far away is the other object's mass.

Then, out pops a value that tells you the magnitude of force that an object would exert on another object w.r.t. their mass that was dropped right where that vector was.

To see how we could do this, and how it relates to electrostatics, see [[KBhPHYS201GravitationalFields]] Newton's Law of Gravitation.

* A van de graff generator!
    * Electrostatics zap happen after crank turned
    * But, how does it work?
        * Cranks connects to a white roller, and next to it some metal teeth
        * Roller connnects to transparent belt, and on the other end, under the globe, there is a similar roller
        * Metal combs next to rollers
    * When cranks are turned, the bottom roller becomes negative, and the top roller becomes positive
    * So, electron flow between handle (connected to bottom) and globe (connected to top)

 * Van de graff generator so exciting because, unlike normal statics, charges are added from the inside (see, wire B)
     * When you add additional changes, because conductor wants to stay 0, the additional charges can't do anything but accept it 
     * Sphere slightly curved to make up for gaping hole
     * Normal door-handle statics would much rater simply eject the added change  as their electric field is pointed at one direction against charge introduction
 * Let's talk about the sparks!
     * One dome that's positive, one dome is negative
     * So, what happens when Spark! happens?
         * Enough charge to overcome the electric field resistance of air (like 3.4 million Volts/metre), and **air ionizes** — air atoms becomes so attracted that their electrons ditch their nuclei
         * Neutral air has high resistance, but when it ionizes, the air looses its resistance (drops) and becomes nicely conductive
         * So then, current (Coulomb/s) that flow in the air suddenly spark up because of sudden loss of resistance, discharging the negative dom
