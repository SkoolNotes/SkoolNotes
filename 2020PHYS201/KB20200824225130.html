            <p>With masses (and w.r.t. [[KB20200824224553]] gravitational fields), it’s easy. Masses always <em>attracts</em> because negative mass doesn’t exist (<em>yet</em>). But, with an electric field, figuring out directions is harder.</p>
            <p>So, we have two choices to dealing with directions:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>Electric field of any <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> has two values, one “attract field” and one “repel field”</li>
            <li>Drawing a single vector <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E}\)</span>, but remember that the direction of the vector depends on what’s dropped in it</li>
            </ol>
            <p>USE OPTION <strong>2</strong>.</p>
            <p>In this manner, when we say, “this atom has a electric field vector in this direction”, we mean two things</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>When a positive test change is dropped onto that vector, it will experience force in the same direction as the vector</li>
            <li>When a negative "" "" "“,”" "" "" the opposite direction as the vector</li>
            </ol>
            <h2 id="illustrating-electric-fields">Illustrating Electric Fields</h2>
            <p>There are two ways of illustrating electric fields — either drawing an infinite amount of vectors (that’s a lot of vectors), or drawing lines originating from the main particle lining up all the vectors (think! original Japanese flags.)</p>
            <p>See [[KB20200824225536]] illustrating electric fields.</p>

            <p>If the charges on a conductor are stationary…</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>E-field <em>in</em> the conducting material must be zero
            <ul>
            <li>Because, uhh…., the conductor is stationary, meaning no electron flow</li>
            <li>So, without electric flow, you know that there is no motivation for electrons to flow, which means no electric field</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>At the surface of the conductor, if any E-field is present, it must be perpendicular to the surface
            <ul>
            <li>If you have a horizontal component, the conductor would be, well, <em>conducing</em> electricity, making it rather not static</li>
            <li>If the E-Field is perpendicular, because we are in the Physics Vacuum, no charges will flow because it can’t flow out of the conductor into something else</li>
            </ul></li>
            </ol>

            <p>Take, a neutral conductor.!</p>

            <p>At the point of the cursor, there would be an electric field cause by the central charge going outwards; at which point the following will happen…</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>The red (positive) charge attracts electrons to the inside of the tube</li>
            <li>These newly electrons set up their own electric fields equal and opposite to the electric field by the central electron (because of the Electric Field Deux. Gravitational Field thing)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>So, the conductor has a net electric field of 0. It’s static.</p>
            <p>Because of the fact that the neutral conductor had both 1) and 2) going on, there is no tangent changes to the conductor (<strong>think!</strong> rule 2 aforementioned), and only field lines that are perpendicular (emitted by the red, positive charge), will be passed out.</p>
