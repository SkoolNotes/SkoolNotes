# Calculations Surrounding a Circuit
There KBhHIST201BullietCh19are two ways to calculate the resistance within a circuit. In reality, they are all based on the same set of rules â€” but one way applies them directly and the other uses a higher-level abstraction that is often easier.

Either way, this is the are the rules that rules them all:  **through a resistor, the Current does NOT change, the Voltage drops.**
 
## Kirkoff's Laws
These are the basic rules of circuit calculation: [[KBhPHYS201KirkoffsLaws]]

## Combining Resistors Method
Combining resistors is a generalization of the Kirkoff's Laws to makes calculating circuits easier. [[KBhPHYS201CombiningResistors]]
