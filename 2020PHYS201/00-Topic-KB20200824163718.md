# An atom
We begin by recognizing the fact that **it's the electron that can move around in an atom.**.

For now, materials could be either **Conductors** or **Insulators.**

* **Conductors**
    * $e^-$ move freely
    * Think! Metal
* **Insulators**
    * $e^-$ cannot move freely
    * Think! Wood/Glass/Plastic

## Charge properties
> Different materials have tendencies to have a charge when rubbed

* Human hands => very positive when rubbed
* Fur => positive when rubbed
* Steel, Wood, Polyester => meh
* Plastics => negative when rubbed
* Silicon/Teflon => very negative when rubbed

### Change Interactions

* Like changes tend to repel
* Different changes tend to attract

### Rods and Paper
![Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 4.46.46 PM.png](/Users/houliu/Documents/School Work/2020-2021/KnowledgeBase/2020PHYS201/Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 4.46.46 PM.png){width=70%}

**Scenario 1** 

* Taking neutral rod + close, positively charged, rod
    * Electrons will move from the neutral rod to the charged rod
    * Balances the charge out
 
 **Scenario 2**
 
* Taking neutral rod + slightly farther, positively charged, rod
    * The neutral rod "polarizes", repelling the positively charged protons off to one side while attracting all the electrons towards it
    * There is a net force of attraction to the "left" on the example image — towards the charged rod
     
Recall that per the physics[[KB20200824111828]] D1 At home Activity, pieces of paper sometime flow towards the charged rod, then back again. Why?

About how that works…
    
1. The charged rod polarizes the paper
2. The paper's newfound positive end attract with the plastic rod's negative end
3. The paper has a net positive force towards the rod, so it accelerates towards it
4. Electrons, once connected, tries to flow back onto the paper
5. The paper neutralizes, then falls to the ground
6. Repeat from (1)


### The Electroscope

![Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 7.31.10 PM.png](/Users/houliu/Documents/School Work/2020-2021/KnowledgeBase/2020PHYS201/Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 7.31.10 PM.png)

About how this works…

1. Bring in some external charge near the electromitor (the ball-y part)
2. The rod becomes polarized, pushing the $+$ protons down towards the "gold leaves"
    * If the rod is not close enough to cause electron flow but is close enough to polarize…
        * Gold leaves temporarily push apart because positive repels positives
        * When charged rod removed, leaves come back
    * If the rod is close enough to cause $e^-$ to flow out of the electromitor, making the whole rod more positive instead of a temporary polarization…
        * Gold leaves permanently (until somebody/the air discharges it, anyways) separated
        * When charged rod removed, leaves stay put
        
# Quantifying electrical force!

* Electrical forces gets stronger as charge increases
* Electrical forces gets weaker as charge decreases

> The magnitude of force between two charges is given by the Columb's Law

\definition[where $k$, a constant for change, $q_1$, change of first particle, $q_2$, change of second partical, $r^2$, distance squared]{Coulumb's Law}{$k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$}

Note! The Standard Unit of Charge (Q) is the Coulomb — a representation for change for many electrons or many protons

**Remember this!**

\definition{Charge of an Electron}{$-1.602 \times 10^{-19} Q$}

\definition{k}{$8.99 \times 10^9 \frac{Nm^2}{Q^2}$}

> E.M. forces, really, are two forces interacting with each other

**Notice! Be careful with the signs when applying coulumbs law**

* If resulting Coulomb force > 0, force is REPULSIVE (became you multiplied positive to positive or negative negative)
* If resulting Coulomb force < 0, force is ATTRACTIVE (became you multiplied positive to negative)

## And now, a Guided Problem Solve

![Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 8.06.36 PM.png](/Users/houliu/Documents/School Work/2020-2021/KnowledgeBase/2020PHYS201/Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 8.06.36 PM.png)

**Notice! This one is a little different because there are three charges.**

We could see that, because of the fact that $Q_2$ is closer to $Q3$ then $Q1$ is and the two particles are pulling in different directions, we could infer that $||F_{32}||$ is larger then $||F_{31}||$. Because of this, we could find that $Q_3$ will have a net force "to the left" — in $F_{32}$'s direction. 

And, because of that, we know that $Q_3$ will be accelerating towards the left. But **Notice**!, whenever $Q_3$ moves towards the left, the distances between the particles changed, meaning the force acting upon $Q_3$ changes! Meaning, $Q_3$'s acceleration "to the left" is not constant. Unfortunately, then, no equation of kinematics for us :(.

## Here's something! DNA Replication

![Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 8.20.15 PM.png](/Users/houliu/Documents/School Work/2020-2021/KnowledgeBase/2020PHYS201/Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 8.20.15 PM.png)

The question is… Between these four atoms, _how many do we need to calculate to find if these two repel or attract?_

This is fairly simple. Because of the fact every force between each pair of atoms between these two elements needs to be calculated. So… 2 (on the left) times 2 (on the right) = 4.

If these repel, the don't combine. If they attract, of course they do.

# Gravity!

Each object has what's called **gravitational field.** Surrounding each object has what is effectively many tiny vectors getting weaker and weaker as you move away from the Earth. You could calculate the force of gravity just by knowing…

1. The mass of what you are calculating.
2. How far away is the other object's mass.

Then, out pops a value that tells you the magnitude of force that an object would exert on another object w.r.t. their mass that was dropped right where that vector was.

Remember, this is _not the gravitational force_ between two objects. This is simply the _gravitational FIELD_ of one. To calculate the force of gravity, simply use multiply the mass of the attractee to the gravitational field of the attractor, that is, $F_{grav} = M_{obj2} * GravField_{obj1}$.

## Newton's Law of Gravitation

And for actually calculating the gravitational field, you will need

\definition[where $G$ is a constant called "Gravitational constant"]{(A part of) Newton's Law of Gravitation}{$Grav. Field = \frac{G M_{source}}{R^2}$}

For good measure, here's the two equations combined to form the full gravitational field.

\definition{Newton's Law of Gravitation}{$F_{grav} = M_{target} \frac{G M_{source}}{R^2}$}

It does not actually matter which object is the target and which one is the source. Because of an magical property called the "Multiplication is Commutative", swapping attractor and attractee will have the same numerical result for gravitational force. (_note! the field vectors are still different though_)

The units for *Gravitational Field* is $\frac{N}{kg}$, which, the keen-eyed will see, equals $\frac{m}{s^2}$, which, of course, is acceleration.

And now for a old piece of news:

\definition{(Roughly) Earth's Gravitational Field}{$9.8\frac{N}{kg} = 9.8\frac{m}{s^2}$}

## Electric Field Striketh Back
You will notice that the _Electric Field_ works very similarly to the _Gravitational Field_

To recall, Coulomb's Law looks like $F_{attraction} = k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{R^2}$, which is eerily similar to the Force of Gravity, $F_{grav} = G\frac{M_2M_2}{R^2}$.

And so, by the some token, we could also redefined electric force as:

\definition[where $E$ is $Q_2$'s electric field]{Electric Force}{$F_{attraction} = E Q_1$}

Unsurprisingly, the units for *Electric Field* is $\frac{N}{C}$, and no, before you get excited, there is nothing it equals.

# Electric Fields
With masses, it's easy. Masses always *attracts* because negative mass doesn't exist (_yet_). But, with electric field,  figuring out directions is harder.

So, we have two choices to dealing with directions:

1) Electric field of any $Q$ has two values, one "attract field" and one "repel field"
2) Drawing a single vector $\vec{E}$, but remember that the direction of the vector depends on what's dropped in it

USE OPTION **2**.

In this manner, when we say, "this atom has a electric field vector in this direction", we mean two things

1. When a positive test change is dropped onto that vector, it will experience force in the same direction as the vector
2. When a negative "" "" "", "" "" "" the opposite direction as the vector

## Illustrating Electric Fields

Yes, you could do this.


![Oooh! A **single** vector!](/Users/houliu/Documents/School Work/2020-2021/KnowledgeBase/2020PHYS201/Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 8.54.03 PM.png)

And theoretically draw infinite metric tonnes of these around an object. But that's inefficient. We could instead think about electric fields as infinitely expanding in lines that travel from the center of the object outwards:


![Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 8.57.21 PM.png](/Users/houliu/Documents/School Work/2020-2021/KnowledgeBase/2020PHYS201/Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 8.57.21 PM.png)

Well, here's a problem. This diagram does not show the magnitude of the charge. 

Well, fear not! Notice that there are shaded circles behind the red arrows? The density of these circles dictate the magnitude of the charge — the denser the circles, the higher the magnitude.

## And now, lot's of these

Imagine if we had… Well… Lot's of these:


![Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.01.47 PM.png](/Users/houliu/Documents/School Work/2020-2021/KnowledgeBase/2020PHYS201/Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.01.47 PM.png)

In this diagram, A + B are both positive. The diagram, now, shows *both* electric field vectors for  A and B. Take, for instance, 

This tidbit:
![Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.04.52 PM.png](/Users/houliu/Documents/School Work/2020-2021/KnowledgeBase/2020PHYS201/Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.04.52 PM.png)

If we connected it back to A and B, you will get:

![Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.05.26 PM.png](/Users/houliu/Documents/School Work/2020-2021/KnowledgeBase/2020PHYS201/Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.05.26 PM.png)

As you could see, the force from B is smaller because the point is farther away from B.

Ok, now, let's see the *net* electric field by adding all of these vectors up:


![Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.07.26 PM.png](/Users/houliu/Documents/School Work/2020-2021/KnowledgeBase/2020PHYS201/Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.07.26 PM.png)

Nice! You are, at this point, hopefully seeing something of a symmetry. Remember how we had two ways of drawing an electric field? That

1) You choose to draw an infinite amount of vectors, or
2) You draw lines from the center of each element outwards, connecting all the vectors

If we do option 2, you see this lovely image:

![Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.10.52 PM.png](/Users/houliu/Documents/School Work/2020-2021/KnowledgeBase/2020PHYS201/Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.10.52 PM.png)

Please, be also reminded of the fact that the world is 3D, making the diagram more like this:


![Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.24.48 PM.png](/Users/houliu/Documents/School Work/2020-2021/KnowledgeBase/2020PHYS201/Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.24.48 PM.png)

Great. Lastly there are other possible configurations of charges apart from positive-positive, and they are as follows:


![Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.25.58 PM.png](/Users/houliu/Documents/School Work/2020-2021/KnowledgeBase/2020PHYS201/Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.25.58 PM.png)

As you could see. There is a lovely point (yes, it's actually a point, but people are lazy and don't to draw, say _infinite_ field lines) in the middle of Neg-Neg and Pos-Pos electric field graphs with a lovely hole.  At that hole, the field value is 0.

(Thanks Mr. Valdez!)

Here's a gallery of electric fields with unequal changes:

![Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.28.56 PM.png](/Users/houliu/Documents/School Work/2020-2021/KnowledgeBase/2020PHYS201/Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.28.56 PM.png)

As you could see, the higher amount of field lines, the higher is the strengths. If each charge's field "bends" towards the other, (i.e. particles that go _AAAAA I AM GOING TO OVERTAKE THE OTHER PARTICLE'S FIELD LINES_)

## Conductors and Electric field

If the charges on a conductor are stationary…

1) E-field _in_ the conducting material must be zero
   * Because, uhh...., the conductor is stationary, meaning no electron flow
   * So, without electric flow, you know that there is no motivation for electrons to flow, which means no electric field
2) At the surface of the conductor, if any E-field is present, it must be perpendicular to the surface
    * If you have a horizontal component, the conductor would be, well, _conducing_ electricity, making it rather not static
    * If the E-Field is perpendicular, because we are in the Physics Vacuum, no charges will flow because it can't flow out of the conductor into something else
    
### An now, something interesting
Take, a neutral conductor.!


![Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.44.46 PM.png](/Users/houliu/Documents/School Work/2020-2021/KnowledgeBase/2020PHYS201/Screen Shot 2020-08-24 at 9.44.46 PM.png)

At the point of the cursor, there would be an electric field cause by the central charge going outwards; at which point the following will happen…

1) The red (positive) charge attracts electrons to the inside of the tube
2) These newly electrons set up their own electric fields equal and opposite to the electric field by the central electron (because of the Electric Field Deux. Gravitational Field thing)

So, the conductor has a net electric field of 0. It's static.

Because of the fact that the neutral conductor had both 1) and 2) going on, there is no tangent changes to the conductor (**think!** rule 2 aforementioned), and only field lines that are perpendicular (emitted by the red, positive charge), will be passed out.
