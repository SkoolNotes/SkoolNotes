\hypertarget{nuclear-physics}{%
\section{Nuclear Physics}\label{nuclear-physics}}

First of all, recall {[}{[}KBhPHYS201ColoumbsLaw{]}{]}. Given the force
between two particles is \(\frac{kQ^2}{R^2}\), we could hand-wavily
calculate the \emph{work} between two particles if we know how much they
travel near/far from each other. Through this, we could show that
nuclear forces (through nuclear distance, proton=\textgreater electron)
are much larger than that of the chemical forces (atom/atom,
electron=\textgreater electron).

\#compilefromnote

Remember: \(A_{nucl} = \frac{1}{10^{10}} A_{atom}\)

\hypertarget{radioactivity}{%
\subsection{Radioactivity}\label{radioactivity}}

Radiation is the emition of waves --- lights, heat, etc. etc. We call
something ``radioactive'' if it emits ionizing radiation: that it has
enough energy to liberate an electron from an atom.

\hypertarget{geiger-counter}{%
\subsubsection{Geiger Counter}\label{geiger-counter}}

\#inserthowgeigercountersowrk

Because of the fact that Geiger counters require time to discharge,
there is a certain rate called ``dead time'' during which Geiger
counters simply sit and do nothing. As such, we have to account for this
lossy ``deadtime'' of Geiger counters by relating the two values with
the following equation

\(T = \frac{M}{1-(M/L)}\), where \(M\) is the measured rate of radiation
and \(L\) is the ``dead time'' --- the upper limit of the Geiger counter
in question.

\hypertarget{radio-charge-types}{%
\subsubsection{Radio Charge Types}\label{radio-charge-types}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\alpha\): positively charged + relatively massive (low
  \(\frac{q}{m}\))
\item
  \(\beta\): negatively charged + relatively high charge (high
  \(\frac{q}{m}\))
\item
  \(\gamma\): neutral
\end{itemize}

This could be seen by how these three types of charge curve into a
magnetic field.

Why? Apply right hand rule 1.5.

\hypertarget{creating-a-ray}{%
\subsubsection{Creating a ray}\label{creating-a-ray}}

``Split a nucleus, somehow''

\textbf{Alpha Decay}:

\includegraphics{alphadecay.png}

During alpha decay, a massive nucleolus spits out a Helium-resulting
part of itself to get rid of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So,
formally\ldots{}

\includegraphics{alphadecaybetter.png}

\textbf{Gamma Decay}

Instead of splitting part of the nucleus, gamma decay spits an
electrically excited (so\ldots{} chemistry, charged, energy level, that
stuff) atom into a normal, non-excited atom and also emits a photon.

\includegraphics{gammadecaybetter.png}

\includegraphics{gammadecay.png}

And now, the most confusing one\ldots{}

\textbf{Beta Decay} There's two types of beta decay: ``beta-minus''
decay and ``beta-plus'' decay. When folks talk about just
``beta-decay'', they are talking about beta-minus decay.

An element decays from the parent element into a different nucleus.

\emph{Beta minus decay}

\includegraphics{betaminusdecay.png}

In this case, the nucleus gained a proton and lost a neutron.

What happened? A neutron in the nucleus turned into a positive proton
and a negative electron. The newly-formed electron comes flying out as a
``beta-minus'' particle. Also, this process creates an ``antineutrino'',
which is a tiny, charge-less element that will become important later.

\emph{Beta plus decay}

\includegraphics{betaplusdecay.png}

This is the opposite of beta-minus decay. The element takes one of its
protons, splits it to a positron (a positive electron, this is
antimatter), a neutrino, and a neutron.

Wait\ldots{} But \emph{how}?

\includegraphics{betadecaybackwards.png}

Beta-minus decay makes sense, because it would been energetically
favorable as a neutron is \emph{slightly} more massive and hence will
loose some of the mass during beta-minus decay. But, during beta-plus
decay, the reactants are less massive than the product (!!) --- so
thermally it won't really work out.

\includegraphics{betadecayisreallybackwards.png}

So, in order to actually create beta-plus decay, you have to shove the
protons, antimatter, etc. together really fast with some kinetic energy.
Or, this could happen spontaneously as long as the mass of the daughter
atom is smaller than the mass of the parent (as in\ldots{} as long as
mass of daughter + mass of anti electron + mass of neutrino \textless{}
mass of parent, this should work.)

To make sense of this, stop thinking that atoms' masses could be
deducted by just counting the number of neutrons+protons.

\emph{Electron capture}

\includegraphics{electroncapture.png}

In this case, you will gain one neutron by simply capturing an electron
out of thin air (the electron cloud) and merge it with a proton to form
a neutron and an antineutrino.

So, together\ldots{}

\includegraphics{betadecayformal.png}

\emph{Positron Capture}

This basically does not happen; it basically should work in a similar
manner as does electron capture but the opposite.

\includegraphics{positironcapture.png}

You will need lots of pressure to squish two positive things together
(Electrons + Protons) to fuse.

\hypertarget{absorbtion-of-radioactivity}{%
\subsubsection{Absorbtion of
Radioactivity}\label{absorbtion-of-radioactivity}}

\includegraphics{absorbtion.png}

As the thickness of the absorber increases, the relative intensity of
radiation exponentially, asymtotically decreases.

This is similar to the equatino of a dischanging capacitor; namely
\(e^(\frac{-time}{\tau})\)

Instead of a smooth curve, we will decay by 2. We wil use it like a half
life calculation:

\(int = 0.5^{\frac{t}{T}}\), where \(T\) is the thickness required to
absorb 50\%, and \(t\) the thickness of the material. \(int\) should be
the relative intensity of the material --- a percentage
(0\textless=R\textless=1) that represents how much of the original,
unhindered charge is disturbed.

\includegraphics{halflife.png}

Relative intensity + half life problem 3:

\includegraphics{halflifeproctice.png}

\hypertarget{stopping-rays}{%
\subsubsection{Stopping Rays}\label{stopping-rays}}

\(\alpha\), \(\beta\), and \(\gamma\) rays are strong in that order ---
alpha rays could be stopped with less insulation than beta than gamma.
HOWEVER, this is given that they all have the same \emph{energy}.
Different rays of the same energy would apply like this, but otherwise
the energy matters especially for betas.

\hypertarget{atomic-stability}{%
\subsubsection{Atomic Stability}\label{atomic-stability}}

\textbf{Please remember: most nuclei are stable!! Basically everyday
things does not give you any meaningful amount of radiation.}

\includegraphics{stablenuclei.png}

For relatively low protoned atoms, (\(p < 30\)), stable nuclei is when
\(N \approx p\). For larger atoms, \(N \approx < 1.5P\).

Vocab! Nucleon: neutron + proton.

The standard deviation of \(N\) counts is the \(\sqrt(N)\) if there is a
uniformly random distribution.

\hypertarget{fission-and-fusion}{%
\subsection{Fission and Fusion}\label{fission-and-fusion}}

Changes though \textbf{fission} (one nucleaus become two pieces,
probably due to the partent absorbing a neutron, a.k.a. more equal parts
of alpha decay) or \textbf{fusion} (two nuclei joining together to form
one)

Due to conservation of energy, not every fission/fusion releases energy.
If fission of A =\textgreater{} B C releases energy, fusion of B+C
=\textgreater{} A wil not.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./Pasted image 20210118092740.png}
\caption{Pasted image 20210118092740.png}
\end{figure}

You could think of the energy released as part of fission as the
potential energy of a system.

The bottom row of ``mass number'' is nucleons w.r.t. the most common
izotope

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics{./Pasted image 20210118093104.png}
\caption{Pasted image 20210118093104.png}
\end{figure}

Iron is a terriable way of getting some energy out of a atom because it
has the lowest ever potential energy

Nuclear processes usually end up with Iron; like\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you are on the ``blue''/``left'' region, you release energy by
  fusioning into iron (add stuff up until you get to stable iron.)
\item
  If you are on the ``yellow''/``right'' region, you release energy by
  fissioning into iron (split until you get to iron)
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

But actually this is kind of a lie. It is actully a contour of all
different izotopes, measured in ``binding'' energy and not PE. The
\textbf{binding energy} is how forcibly the nucleaus are bound together
--- the more tighly bound, the more energy it would require to break the
binding.

Also, Binding Energy is measured in MeV, which convents to Joules with
\(1 MeV = 1.6 \times 10^{-13} J\).

Nuclear fission is triggered by smushing a neutron into an atom.

For instance\ldots{}

\hypertarget{what-is-best-fit}{%
\subsection{What is ``best fit''}\label{what-is-best-fit}}

{[}{[}Pasted image 20210120112247.png{]}{]}

When data is uncertain, best fit should minimize
\(\sum \frac{D_i-M_i}{\sigma_i}^2\). Think as ``how many standard
deviations away'' is the uncertainty. This is also called ``pearson's
statistic''

With this piece of information, at different discrete values of T, we
could have a graph of T vs.~S. At the minimum of that curve, that's the
best fit!

Smin should be about \# of datapoints - \# of parametres

If Smin \textless\textless{} \# dp - \# params, you did something wrong.

If Smin \textgreater\textgreater{} \# dp - \# params, sigma were
probably underestimated/not the only sources of error

\tightlist
\item
  Pressurized water reactor =\textgreater{} Pressured, superheated water
  superheats nearby water to steam
\item
  Boiling water reactor =\textgreater{} Reactor directly heat
\end{enumerate}

Pressured water reactor has control SCRAM rods above, because steam is
not dried within the reactor. Boiling water reactors have control rods
below, because the output steam's dryer is above and hence control rods
needs to be place below.

The fuel rods contain UO2,with about 3\% being U. The rest is the
radioactive slowly decaying common 238U. Uranium ore comes out as 0.7\%
235U, but we need that to be 3\% b/c fissioning 238U is not helpful, so
a process called ``enrichment'' helps purify the Uranium and rid of 238
to leave only 235.

Raw fuel isn't super radioactive. But, once the fuel is insterted, a
neutron gets shot in and the recator starts. Control rods could be
inserted in to stop teh reaction. \#why

Spent fuel is radioactive. Raw U238 does not go through much decay
(see\ldots{} 4.8 Billion Years), but what comes out of the fissioning
process is two random elements that could be quite radioactive.

Also, Plutonium, a result of Uranium fission, also is toxic chemically
