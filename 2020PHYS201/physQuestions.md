- Electrostatics
	- Charged plates
		- Q: Charges are applied to plates, but no charge flows. It just creates electrostatic fields which causes charges to flow in the neutral conductor.
		- Q: With the charged plates, if there was no neutral conductor, would the field stay uniform? (Because there is no equilibrium to be reached)
		- Q: Where exactly is the $E_net = 0$ range in the central neutral conductor with hole? Does it extend outside, since the charges have flowed within the conductor to make it neutral?
