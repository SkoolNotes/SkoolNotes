# Magnetic Solids
Diamagnetic Fields

- Contents induced that travels in the opposite direction of the material
- These "magnets" will repel permanent magnets when there is a meaningful magnetic field is applied
- Every material intrinsically has a diamagnetic property

Paramagnetic Fields

- Each atoms have "unpaired electrons" â€” electrons are oriented at a random spin
- When a magnetic field is applied, the electrons align with the direction of the magnetic field.
- Upon removal of the magnetic field, the electrons get randomly spun again

Ferromagnetic Fields

- Unpaired electrons already partially align to each other
-
