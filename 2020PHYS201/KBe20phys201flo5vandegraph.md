corona discharge from a sharp point
- charges ground off a point easier than 

current = which way and how much
- low current high voltage is fine
- hot dogs in a microwave (poke holes)
- current kills not voltage

- #question How does the comb keep depositing charge onto the rubber belt?
	- something about glass creates static charge with rubber, minuses on the inside inducing dipole in rubber atoms (atoms rotate) and pluses on outside? Which attracts more charge from the ground?
