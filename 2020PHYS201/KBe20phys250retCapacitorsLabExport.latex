\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}}

A number of circuits were built, with the same structure but differing
resistances and capacitances. The voltage across the capacitor and the
current through the circuit were measured over time using a voltage and
amperage probe with Logger Pro.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics{./KBe20phys250srcCapacitorLabCircuitSchematic.png}

\end{figure}

Section 3 uses a different approach to analyze this data, and Section 4
discusses the time constant as measured using a multimeter and
stopwatch, all on the same basic circuit. The raw data can be found
\href{https://nuevaschool.instructure.com/courses/2851/assignments/52558}{on
Canvas}. Desmos was used to manually fit curves to the data, using a
modified version of the model with \(t\) and \(t_0\) variables to
truncate scrap data: \[
V_{cap} = V_{bat}\left(1-e^{-\frac{t - t_0}{\tau}}\right)
\] The scattered points near the x-axis are residuals between the curve
fit and the collected data. The fit heuristic was to visually center the
dots around the x-axis.

The results of the fits are summarized below:

\hypertarget{analysis}{%
\subsection{Analysis}\label{analysis}}

The curve fits included a parameter for \(\tau\), and the model predicts
\(\tau = RC\). Thus, the values and uncertainties for resistance and
capacitance of each circuit were multiplied and compared to the visual
best fit \(\tau\) in the table above.

Because each fit was done manually, the absolute error was difficult to
estimate because there was no correct answer. Instead, error was taken
as the precision at which the number was considered ``close enough'' by
the human doing the curve fit. Depending on the size of the value (and
scale of the Desmos slider), this results in an absolute error ranging
from 0.1 units to 0.001 units.

These uncertainties were propagated through calculations as follows: \[
\begin{aligned}
\delta (A+B) = \sqrt{\delta A^2 + \delta B^2}\\
\frac{\delta (AB)}{AB} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\delta A}{A}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\delta B}{B}\right)^2}
\end{aligned}
\] for additive and multiplicative one operations respectively.

The manufacturing tolerances of electronic components were taken into
account as well. Resistor tolerances were based on the absolute
difference between standard resistances and those measured by a
multimeter. Capacitance tolerances were based on the tolerances of a
similar capacitor for which the
\href{http://www.paullinebarger.net/DS/Foai/Foai\%20\%5Bradial\%20thru-hole\%5D\%20CD110\%20Series.pdf}{data
sheet} was available: the FOAI CD110 radial capacitor, which had
capacitance tolerances of \(\pm\) 20\%.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

Assuming perfect capacitor manufacturing, the curve fit results fell
within uncertainties of the model predicted \(\tau\) value for all
circuits except the fit in Figure 1. This is likely due to the high
uncertainties placed on smaller scale curve fits, especially the final
trial. Furthermore, with the unexpectedly large 20\% uncertainties in
capacitance all trials fell within the uncertainties of the experiment.
Thus, the model predicted the charging behavior of capacitors over time
accurately. For future iterations, numerical errors could have been
better predicted if the specifications of the exact parts used to build
the circuit were available. Additionally, more systematic curve fit
heuristics could have been used such as RSME. The exact numerical
analysis for this section can be found
\textbf{\href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hw9ooz0CtAvTP9vtw1VT9pVyfsW39IojwwrQX94VJQY/edit?usp=sharing}{here}}.

\hypertarget{integration-of-current}{%
\section{Integration of Current}\label{integration-of-current}}

\hypertarget{procedure-1}{%
\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-1}}

Another way to evaluate the model is to compare the amount of
transferred charge. For this comparison, a modified equation is used:

\[
Q_{cap}=Q_{max}\left(1-e^{-\frac{t-t_{0}}{\tau}}\right)
\]

This is similar to the model used in the previous procedure, but voltage
variables are replaced with charge. Current flow through the circuit is
used as a proxy to calculate the amount of charge accumulated in the
capacitor. As before, current is measured across a resistor using a
digital probe and Logger Pro.

The amount of charge on the capacitor was calculated by taking a Riemann
sum of the momentary current measurements. In addition, the voltage
measurements across the capacitor were used as another proxy to
calculate the amount of charge on the capacitor.

\hypertarget{results-1}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results-1}}

The values of the three theoretically identical methods of calculating
capacitor charge are shown below:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRfxrZPfJZareibOZN-KammmgQDBDb5PVMBNmzCvUb_0tSn_TUNsLFQPM8ehfIKGEOaIhL86IoPFdb0/pubchart?oid=483417085\&format=image}
\caption{Accumulated Charge Graph}
\end{figure}

In addition, the final accumulated charge calculated by the Riemann sum
was 0.00319C, or the equivalent of 3.19V on the capacitor.

\hypertarget{analysis-1}{%
\subsection{Analysis}\label{analysis-1}}

As the graph shows, both proxies of charge on the capacitor generally
agree with the model but come up with smaller values of charge. Notably,
the two experimental proxies don't agree with each other either,
suggesting some systematic error is at play.

One culprit may be misaligned data: if the Riemann sum calculation began
after charging, then the entire sum would be skewed low. However, the
sum plot is not a vertical translation of the theoretical value, which
suggests the effect of this issue is minimal or canceled. Another issue
may be miscalibrated sensors: if each amperage measurement was off by
\(10^{-5}\)A, the cumulative affect would drag down the total as time
went on. The effect of this drift can be counteracted by taking the
average of readings when no charge should be flowing, multiplying by the
number of data points, and subtracting the total from the final charge
value. However, the calculated drift was an order of magnitude greater
than the total accumulated charge, so the author did not numerically
sanitize against this drift.

Although the intermediate charge values do not match the model, the
final accumulated charge is sensical: 3.19 volts is close to the
expected 3.2 volts. The same errors mentioned previously contribute to
this difference, but the accuracy of the result suggests that the effect
was canceled.

The Farad Definition line (red) in Figure 6 has blips for unkown
reasons. When the battery was off, the probe measured voltages on the
order of \(10^{-9}\) for a few ticks before measuring a faulty value, so
a similar stepping phenomenon may be occuring in the voltage
meauserement.

\hypertarget{conclusion-1}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-1}}

The Riemann sums of measured current align with the model and expected
charge calculated by the voltage on the capacitor and the definition of
the Farad. Thus, the model accurately predicts experimental behavior,
suggesting that it is correct. Although the graphs differed slightly,
these may be attributed to the subjective curve fit metric, sensor
inaccuracies while measuring small flows of current, or sensor
calibration inaccuracies. Future analysis could be more accurate by
calculating the false zero point of the sensor, using various tick times
to find the most effective range for that sensor, and having more
accurate values for uncertainty for circuit components and the digital
probe.

\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-2}}

Most of the analysis for data collected as a class was done on the
``charge rate constant'' (\texttt{time/RC}) of each circuit, defined as:

\[
\frac{t}{RC}
\]

The same circuit as above was built by various experimentalists, with
multimeter probes on the two sides legs of the capacitor:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./KBe20phys250srcCapacitorLabCircuitSchematic.png}
\caption{Circuit Schematic}
\end{figure}

The physical manifestation of which looked like:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./KBe20phys250srcCapacitorLabCircuit.png}
\caption{Circuit used in experiment: red and black aligator clips
attached to multimeter, battery attatched to the power rails.}
\end{figure}

Starting with discharged capacitors, a battery was connected to the
circuit and used to charge the capacitor. The time taken for the voltage
across the capacitor to reach 2 \(\pm\) 0.01 volts was measured for
various resistor and capacitor combinations.

\hypertarget{results-2}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results-2}}

\texttt{time/RC} is a unitless scalar that represents how quickly it
takes to charge any capacitor for a given voltage. Voltage data was not
collected during the experiment, so the voltage is assumed to be
constant across trials. If our model of capacitor charge rate is
correct, we expect \texttt{time/RC} to be constant across trials. The
actual data was skewed right:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTdonVC_CHgEAoezSnGLXLRFZMhR0_IfTl8anSSMXwEDUR4iNzQbhVJGY8PyUq2e946cMuQbj5TSex_/pubchart?oid=587065174\&format=image}
\caption{Histogram of time/RC}
\end{figure}

By comparing the \texttt{time/RC} and different properties of each
circuit, reasoning for the outliers may be deduced. The visualization of
the histogram is reflected in each of the following charts by the
density of points in a column.

First, the \texttt{time/RC} values were compared with the resistance of
the circuit:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTdonVC_CHgEAoezSnGLXLRFZMhR0_IfTl8anSSMXwEDUR4iNzQbhVJGY8PyUq2e946cMuQbj5TSex_/pubchart?oid=1655543849\&format=image}
\caption{time/RC vs Resistance}
\end{figure}

Although some outliers came from circuits with high resistance, the most
skewed ones came from those with least resistance. The same can be said
of capacitance:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTdonVC_CHgEAoezSnGLXLRFZMhR0_IfTl8anSSMXwEDUR4iNzQbhVJGY8PyUq2e946cMuQbj5TSex_/pubchart?oid=1866933099\&format=image}
\caption{time/RC vs Capacitance}
\end{figure}

Finally, the comparison with time taken to charge the capacitor shows
the strongest correlation, which is to be expected because according to
the model, this value is the product of the previous two trends.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTdonVC_CHgEAoezSnGLXLRFZMhR0_IfTl8anSSMXwEDUR4iNzQbhVJGY8PyUq2e946cMuQbj5TSex_/pubchart?oid=716778401\&format=image}
\caption{time/RC vs Time to Charge}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{analysis-2}{%
\subsection{Analysis}\label{analysis-2}}

On explanation for the data skew is reaction time: for lower values of
\(\tau\), the capacitor plateaus faster near 2V and thus the time keeper
may not react as quickly. Components with smaller ratings also need
tighter tolerances to achieve the same relative tolerances, so smaller
capacitors may have relatively higher manufactured variability. The
source analysis for these conclusions can be found
