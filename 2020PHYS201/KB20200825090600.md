1. Something that 
	1. was surprising, 
	2. was disappointing, 
	4. and was exciting

oml we did **three intros each.**

### What we are learning:

> "best way to learn is to teach"

ie. ask peers for help, not barak. 

- Physics tried to describe things completely with math, unlike other sciences which use statistical models.
- Semester one:
	- kinematics!
	- Projectile motion
	- Dynamics! 
	- Energy (defines all of physics, but we don't really know what it is)
	- Momentum
	- Maybe: rotational motion
- Around 30 min per class


##### Grading:
- Aim for profs. Profs are an a. But ofc, go for exemplery! 
- Lots of quizzes



### The map of physics


- Classical
	- Newtons Laws of motion and universal gravitation
		- Also worked on optics, 
			- Waves and cosmology and astrophysics
	- Electromagnetism 
	- Classical and fluid dynamics
	- Fluid dynamics
	- Chaos Theory
	- I'm not going to take notes in this
	- ^ in the 1900s
- Relativity
	- Special relativity
		- Light is at a constant speed to all viewers
	- General relativity 
- Quantum Physics
	- Nuclear physics
	- Particle physics
	- quantum field theory | ties in with special relativity 
- The Chasm of ignorance
	- we can't connect general relativity to quantum physics
	- Also, dark matter and dark energy and such
