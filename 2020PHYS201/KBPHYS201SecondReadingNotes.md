# Meet the Leptons
 - There are three families of subatomic particles
	 - Flavor 1: the electron and it's nuetrino
	 - Flavor 2: the Muon and it's nuetrino
	 - Flavor 3: the the tau lepton and it's nuetrino
 - Leptons carry one-half unit of spin and are either neutral or have 1 negative charge
 - For every lepton there's an anti-lepton with an opposite unit of charge and the same mass
 - Leptons have no known size and in all theories describing them are point particles

## Electrons
 - Electrons are Leptons
