# Meet the Leptons
 - There are three families of subatomic particles
	 - Flavor 1: the electron and it's nuetrino
	 - Flavor 2: the Muon and it's nuetrino
	 - Flavor 3: the the tau lepton and it's nuetrino
 - Leptons carry one-half unit of spin and are either neutral or have 1 negative charge
 - For every lepton there's an anti-lepton with an opposite unit of charge and the same mass
 - Leptons have no known size and in all theories describing them are point particles

### Electrons
 - Electrons are Leptons
 - Has an opposite which is the positron
 - Effectively launched particle physics as we know it
 - Is beta radiation
 - Equations to bridge relativity and quantum mechanics in order to describe the electron predicted 1/2 spin and also anti-matter
	 - Some particles are their own anti-particles

### Radioactivity
 - They realized that helium nucleus's shouldn't be able to escape the nucleus of a particle and that it would have to escape through quantum tunneling
 - Gamma radiation is produced by a change in quantum state of the protons
 - Neutrino was suggested as a way to solve some of beta decay's issues
