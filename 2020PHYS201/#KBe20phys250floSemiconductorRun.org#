* Silicon
** refirenry
*** from sand
*** melted
*** small molten crystal "seed" lower into a vat
*** crystal forms
*** pull cylander from molten reigon
*** ground to form ingots
*** sawed with diamond blade to form wafers
*** wafer scrubbed
*** edges rounded and surfaces ground smooth and to create uniform thickness
*** rinsed and etched in "chemicals" to remove impurities
*** final polish on one side of the wafer
*** all so that there are no scratches or contamination
*** then, measured for resistivity (funct
** structure
*** cubic atomic structure
*** 4 electrons valence shell
*** perfect crystal will have no holes
*** but at room temperature, free electrons can conduct
** impurities called dopants
*** negative
**** arsenic or phospherus
**** one more valence
**** n type crystal because negative free carriers
*** positive
**** boron
**** missing electron acts like positive carrier, "hole"
*** silicon can be either good or poor conductor (semiconductor)
**** controlled by concentration of dopant
