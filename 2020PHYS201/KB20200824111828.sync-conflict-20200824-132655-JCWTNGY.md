*Disclaimer* — because of material differences, nothing happened… I am noting here the supposed responses.

- **Senario 1**: the non-charged pen spins towards ("gets attracted") towards the charged pen
- **Senario 2**: the pens repelled, spinning away from each other
- **Senario 3**: the pen was able to pick up chips of paper through charge, and the paper stuck to the pen. Occasionally, pieces of paper starts bouncing towards and away from the charged pen when the pen is not very close
- **Senario 4 (extra)**: only the rubbed "charged" end of the pen was attracting

***

The rubbing is trying to create a **charge separation** — getting positive electrons "off the fur" and "on the pen". These electrons are able to then come with the pen, and attract various things like paper and pen.
