# Current
Use the variable $I$, a unit $\frac{C}{s}$, $Amps$, to measure current. This also equals $\frac{\Delta V}{Resistance}$. Big resistance, little current. Current is measured in a unit $\frac{C}{s}$, which intuitively makes sense — Current/second is kind of like metres^3/second — it measures, roughly, the "amount of flow"/second.

\definition{Current $I$}{A value measured in unit $\frac{C}{s}$, a.k.a. $Amps$ that measures electron flow}
