# Nuclear Physics
First of all, recall [[KBhPHYS201ColoumbsLaw]]. Given the force between two particles is $\frac{kQ^2}{R^2}$, we could hand-wavily calculate the _work_ between two particles if we know how much they travel near/far from each other. Through this, we could show that nuclear forces are much larger than the
