## How to Deal with Large and Small
 - Scientific notation is required to deal with large and small quantities
	 - This is required in much of particle physics since particles tend to be very small and fast
 - People also ten to create more fitting units for a specific application

### Units
Fentometers are used as a unit of measurement in the atomic world. They're $10^{15}m$. 

For speed we use fractions of the speed of light c ~$3*10^{8}m/s$
