# How to Deal with Large and Small
 - Scientific notation is required to deal with large and small quantities
	 - This is required in much of particle physics since particles tend to be very small and fast
 - People also tend to create more fitting units for a specific application

### Units
**Fentometers** are used as a unit of measurement in the atomic world. They're $10^{15}m$. 

For **speed** we use fractions of the speed of light c ~$3*10^{8}m/s$

**Volts** are used for charge.

**Particle Masses** can also be expressed in eV units. Particle masses are actually pretty large with the eV unit.

**Planck Size** is about $10^{-35}m$

### Relative Scales Distance
 - The nucleus takes up a very small amount of a particle
	 - Comparison drawn here is a basketball in an airport for a large nucleus and a golf ball for smaller ones
 - Electrons occupy in a probability distribution the rest of the space more or less
 - The only viable way to measure distances that small are through scattering experiments involving shooting electrons at say a proton and observing the scatter pattern
	 - The diameter of 1 proton is approximately 1 fermi
 - We live in a relative distance average
 - Short Wavelengths can also be observed to estimate the size of such small particles
 - The Planck size is the smallest meaningful distance before spacetime breaks down into quantum foam

### Relative Scales Speed
 - The fastest anything can go so far as we know is the speed of light
 - It's hard to get anything close to the speed of light, but for stuff like particle accelerators and cosmic rays it isn't super uncommon to get close
 - Mass being the reluctance to accelerate means that the mass-less photon should be the fastest particle requiring no energy to reach the speed of light. For anything to go faster would be difficult.
	 - However, physicists have studied the Tachyon which is theoretically capable of doing so but has not been discovered and also creates strange circumstances

### Relative Scales Time
 - The longest known time is the lifespan of the universe
	 - This is currently estimated to be about 13.7 billion years
 - The speed of light is the natural link between distance and time measurements

### Relative Scales Mass
 - Mass is a measure of inertia meaning how hard something is to accelerate
 - We measure particle's speed by measuring their resistance to acceleration with knowledge of their speed
 - With particle masses it becomes more sensical to use MeV instead of kg since the units make more sense

### Relative Scales Energy
 - Energy and its conservation make it perhaps one of the most important things in physics
 - Kinetic energy and mass energy are the most important types when it comes to particles
	 - Rest mas is different from mass
 - Mass represents a highly concentrated form of energy
	 - A little mass leads to a lot of energy while a lot of energy can yield a little mass
 - In the subatomic world mass and energy are typically both measured using the electron volt
