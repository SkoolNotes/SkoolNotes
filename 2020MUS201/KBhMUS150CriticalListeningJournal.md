**Electric — Alina Baraz**

 - Interesting EQ choice on vocals
 - Syncth panning automation?
 - Vocal filtering action
 - Drum machine being filtered too
 - A LOT of filtering on vocals during chorus + backing vocals being synthesized instead of sung?
 - Male chorus seems to be eqed for bases w/ a pretty low HP
 - Filter and gain automation on synth create "wobbly" effect
 - Ending rain SFX + a mids-only sonud effect
 - More wobbly filtering synth
 
 **Film — Aphox Twin**
 
 - Already, lot's of drum machine action
 - Simple sound texture — but sounds very clean 
 - Feels randomized at times
 - Dropouts!
 
 **Every single thing**
 
 - Filter action
 - Simple drum motif
 - Interesting chorus
 - Not quite sure how to describe the high chorus, but it's slightly off-putting
 
 **Black Qualls**
 
 - Funky filters + funky vocals
 - Syncth cutoff
 - Various EQ effects on the vocals
 - Radio effects

**Ann Arbor 3&4**

- Textured start
- Programmed sequence — cowbells? drumb sequence?
- Unique, semi-irregular synth + pad sequence
- Interesting additional characters — background, auxillrary beats, disk scratches, pads and bells — elements to the music
- Synthesized vocals somewhere at 3:13 — I don't think works very well
- Ending a bit sudden
- Percussion formed central line of song

**Leeway**

- Interesting background texture
- Randomized drum machine
- Vocal gaps + drum gaps immediately follows gaps in beat
 
 **Distance**
 
 - Ahh, yes, the distance
 - Vocals starts quite quietly
 - "Streetside-guitar" vibe
 - Not a large emphasis on percussion — percussion comes behind vocals  + constant "ping" of synth

- EDM! + vocal machine intro
- Baseline actually supplied by... a high-pitched synth?
- EDM + Trap style interlude
- Vocals never clear, used as mostly texture and melody

**Lying has to Stop**
