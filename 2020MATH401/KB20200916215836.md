# Continuity
X is continuous at C if
- lim as x --> c = f\(c\)

F is continuous on I if f is continuous at c for all values of c in I. If f is continuous from the interval (-infinity, infinity) f is continuous.

F is continuous on \[a,b\] if
 - F is continuous on (a,b)
 - limit as f goes to a+ equals f(a)
 - limit as f goes to b- equals f(b)
