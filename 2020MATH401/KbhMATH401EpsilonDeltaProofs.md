# Epsilon Delta Proofs
The secrets of the limit

## Formal Definition of a Limit
 \definition[for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta$ such that $if\ 0<|x-a|<\delta,\ then\  0<|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$]{Limit Definition}{$\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L$}
 
## An Epsilon Delta Proof
Let's prove $\lim_{x\to 2} x^2 = 4$ together!

The crux of the proof is to come up with a value $\delta$ that is a function of $\epsilon$ assuming that $0 < \epsilon$  that meets $0<|x-a|<\delta$.
