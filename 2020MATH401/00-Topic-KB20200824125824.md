# General Aftercare
* Assignments on Canvas (preferably a PDF) 
* Collaborate as much as possible
    * Learn and share ideas together
    * Collaborate well together
* Nikhil TAing!! ;)
* ~30 mins of HW/class period. *time* the assignments and write it down on top. 
* Tests are take home, duh (COVID NOISES!!), and are Assigned Wednesday, Due on Monday)

**Expectations**
* A notebook should be maintained + some solved sample problems
* Homework assigned each class
* HW graded for Habits of Mind rubric

    * Limit laws
    * Evaluating functions
    * Prove limit laws
* Continuity
    * Types of continuity + discontinuity
    * Define continuity
    * Immediate value theorem
        * Application +
        * Boundedness

# So, what _is_ Calculus?
* The analysis of change
* Study of curves
* Study of rate-of-change

## Rate of change
We have seen this before: **Slopes!**

> The rate of change tells you the relation in the trend of the graph. Think! Negative and positive functions!

\definition{First order rate of change}{How much is the function changing over a period of time?}

\definition{Second order difference}{How much is the rate of change changing over time?}
