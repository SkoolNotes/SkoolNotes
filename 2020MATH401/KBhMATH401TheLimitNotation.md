# The Limit Notation
## Single-Sided Limits
\definition["What is $y$ approaching when $x$ approaches $a$ from the right ($+$)?"]{Right Single-Sided Limit}{$\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x)$}

\definition["What is $y$ approaching when $x$ approaches $a$ from the left ($-$)?"]{Left Single-Sided Limit}{$\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x)$}

**Watch!** If both the left and right single-sided limit exists and is the same, the Double-Sided Limit exists.

## Double-sided Limits
\definition["What is $y$ approaching when $x$ approaches $a$?" This exists only if $\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x)=\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x)$ ]{Left Single-Sided Limit}{$\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$}

**Vocab!** When the Double-Sided Limit does not exist, it is called _DOES NOT EXIST!_. It is not!  $\cancel{undefined}$
