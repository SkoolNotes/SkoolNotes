- #define continuity at a point
- $$ \lim_{x\to a}f(x) = f(a) $$
	- To ensure that it is defined, connected on both sides, and doesn't have a random point
	- To check for continuity, just check for $f(a)$, $\lim_{x\to a}f(x)$, and that they are equal
- Rational functions
	- Are continuous on their domains
		- Basically anywhere they are defined
- Discontinuity types
	- Removable discontinuities
		- Hole in the graph
	- infinite is continuity
		- asymtote
	- jump discontinuity
- Continuity from the right and left
	- Same as definition of continuous, but replace the limit with right and left hand limits respectively

- Basically the same thing
- Properties of continuous functions (group like bits)
	- > Let  𝑓  and  𝑔  be continuous functions on an interval  𝐼 , let  𝑐  be a real number and let  𝑛  be a positive integer. The following functions are continuous on  𝐼 .
	> - Sums/Differences :  𝑓±𝑔 
	> - Constant Multiples :  𝑐⋅𝑓 
	> - Products :  𝑓⋅𝑔 
	> - Quotients :  𝑓/𝑔  (as long as  𝑔≠0  on  𝐼 )
	> - Powers :  𝑓𝑛 
	> - Roots : $f(x) = \sqrt[n]{x}$ (if  𝑛  is even then  𝑓≥0  on  𝐼 ; if  𝑛  is odd, then true for all values of  𝑓  on  𝐼 .)
	> - Compositions : Adjust the definitions of  𝑓  and  𝑔  to: Let  𝑓  be continuous on  𝐼, where the range of  𝑓  on  𝐼  is  𝐽 , and let  𝑔  be continuous on  𝐽. Then  𝑔∘𝑓, i.e.,  𝑔(𝑓(𝑥)), is continuous on  𝐼.
