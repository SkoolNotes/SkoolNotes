- #define continuity at a point
$$
\lim_{x\to a}f(x) = f(a)
$$
	- To ensure that it is defined, connected on both sides, and doesn't have a random point
	- To check for continuity, just check for $f(a)$, $\lim_{x\to a}f(x)$, and that they are equal
- Rational functions
	- Are continuous on their domains
		- Basically anywhere they are defined
- Discontinuity types
	- Removable discontinuities
		- Hole in the graph
	- infinite is continuity
		- asymtote
	- jump discontinuity
- Continuity from the right and left
	- Same as definition of continuous, but replace the limit with right and left hand limits respectively
