# First order difference
$\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ (Average slope of the function between two points)

When the first order difference > 0 — as x increases, f(x) _increases_

When first order difference > 0 — as x increases, f(x) _decreases_

# Second order differences
$\frac{\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}}{\Delta x}$ (The "acceleration" of the function)

_This is related to the concavity of the graph!!_

When the second order difference > 0 — the graph should be concave up 

> "As soon as the yoyo is rolled, it is accelerating upwards. First, the acceleration works to slow the downwards velocity. Then, it actually flips the velocity up."

When first order difference > 0 — as x increases, f(x) _decreases_

> "As soon as the ball is tossed, it is accelerating downwards. First, the acceleration works to slow the upwards velocity. Then, it actually flips the velocity down."

# Linear Functions
* No change in slope
* And hence, 0 second order difference
* and so there is no concavity

# Log Functions
They are inverse to expotential functions.

Recall that, for the base graph $y=log(x)$:

1) Domain should be (0, $\infty$)
2) Range is (-$\infty$, $\infty$)
3) As $x \to 0^+$, $y \to -\infty$
4) x-int at $y=0$.

These, of course, are flipped for its sister, inverse function $y=10^x$

1) Range should be (0, $\infty$)
2) Domain is (-$\infty$, $\infty$)
3) As $x\to-\infty$, $y\to0$
4) y-int at $x=0$.
