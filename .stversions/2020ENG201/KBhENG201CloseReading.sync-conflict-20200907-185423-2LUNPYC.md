# Close Reading

\definition{Close Reading}{Unpacking the meaning of individual words and phrases in a text.}

## Goals
* Unpacking the meaning of individual words and phrases in a text
* Consider effects of author's writers
    * W.r.t. the reader's experience
    * W.r.t. the authors too
* Connecting a part => Whole
    * Looking for connections
    * Look for implications
    * Look for how a text changes in its contexts "Marian's text w.r.t. Beigin nationalism"
* Also, a creative effort!

## Framework
#important One way of close reading is to use the following framework:

\definition[Where X is a literary technique, and Y a theme or a broader point]{Close Reading Framework}{The Author uses X to do Y}

When annotating, look forâ€¦ 

* Repetition
* Irony
* Metaphores

etc. But, remember that _this is only the X._ It is not enough to find a device, but you need to analyze _why_ its there.
