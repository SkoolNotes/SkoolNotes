# $Going\ to\ the\ Bakery$
#### *$Elizabeth\ Bishop$*

Written in context of war and rationing and sickness 


Perspective of moon

Describes pastries with humanoid features


> perfect gibberish
Contrast 

Also contrast between cheery bakery and morbid descriptions

Habit...?

Cachaca = strong alcoholic beverage 



- > Terrific money ...?

	- Massive inflation rate increase --- [Inflation Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Miracle#:~:text=To reduce the dependency on,1968 to 34.55%25 in 1974.)
		- This perhaps led to people using their own form of currency, hence **MY** terrific money

		- Also, government made false promises about indexation and debt 
			- Had the largest debt in the world 

				- This led to the 1970 energy crisis, and years of recession and hyperinflation.


Doesn't acknowledge humanity through lack of true communication

Excuse -- gives money, yet still doesn't recognize humanity.

> Invisible Side

= Not recognized by the society or by the speaker  


> Dying, flaccid toy balloons

= Dying promise. Figurative: Iridescence reflects idea? 

```
```
## $Thesis/Brainstorming:$

~~The "black man" is not recognized by the speaker or the society as human, only~~

~~The speakers offhanded treatment of the "black man" represents the colonialists relationship to the colonized~~

###### The speakers off-handed treatment of the "black man" represents the dismissal of the colonized persons humanity. 

> Black, invisible side

Not recognized by the society or the speaker

> He speaks in perfect gibberish

Speaks, but his words are viewed as holding no meaning. 

Giving the money isn't actually helpful but a *symbol* of helpfulness. It's habit. The speaker is not engaging in true interaction, not acknowledging the humanity of the "black man."

> Say 'Good Night' from force of habit. Oh, mean habit! Not one word more apt or bright? 
"Good Night" is completely incorrect. Said out of habit, again, not acknowledging the humanity of the black man. 




#### Theme: false promises

Reflected in flaccid balloons, government to people, and colonialists to colonized 

#todo : ask Alexa how this relates and whether or not to incorporate it.

	- Implemented all kinds of new monetary policies
	- Totally messed with the market 
	- Prior to this, there was no less than 80 - 100% inflation EVERY YEAR. 
	- This short story was written in the midst of all these false promises
	- During inflation, very common to use other forms of currency (*my* money) 
		- cents might refer to US money 


Author uses x and y to convey the overarching theme of false promises, which was a prominent feeling in brazil due to (the coup)

#### Outline:

- Topic Sentence / Thesis
	- Elizabeth Bishop uses symbolism to convey the overarching themes of false promises and deflated optimism, two immensely prominent cultural feelings at the time of writing. 
	- Elizabeth Bishop conveys her feelings of
false promises, deflated optimism 
- Context
	- Coup
		- Was in massive financial crisis, had a coup, implemented new monetary laws and messed with the market, four years later still in a financial crisis. AKA, unfulfilled promises, deflated optimism. 
		- 'This is perhaps most clearly referenced' by the *my* money. 
			- Commonly used other forms of currency when times were bad financially 
- Ex 1. 
	- Flaccid balloons
		- > The tin hides have the iridescence of dying, flaccid toy balloons.
		- Represents the once bright and cheery prospects of new leadership and laws, now deflated. 
		- Balloons are meant to be a promise of joy. (Childish hope)

- Ex. 2
	- Pastries
		- Uses sickly descriptions
			- > The gooey tarts are red and sore
			- > The loaves of bread lie like yellow-fever victims laid out in a crowded ward. 
		- The happiness and hopefulness inherent in the concept of 'pasties'
		- The promise of joy brought by pastries has been broken, the optimism completely sucked out of it.
		- hope has been deflated, rejected, defiled - it's now tainted and repulsive, like illness. viscerally disgusting

- Ex 3. false promises
	- Good night 
	- ``` OR ```
	- False almond 

- Conclusion sentence...?
