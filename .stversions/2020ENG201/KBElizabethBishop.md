# $$Going\ to\ the\ Bakery$$
#### *$Elizabeth\ Bishop$*

Written in context of war and rationing and sickness 


Perspective of moon

Describes pastries with humanoid features


> perfect gibberish
Contrast 

Also contrast between cheery bakery and morbid descriptions

Habit...?

Cachaca = strong alcoholic beverage 



- > Terrific money ...?

	- Massive inflation rate increase --- [Inflation Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Miracle#:~:text=To reduce the dependency on,1968 to 34.55%25 in 1974.)
		- This perhaps led to people using their own form of currency, hence **MY** terrific money

		- Also, government made false promises about indexation and debt 
			- Had the largest debt in the world 

				- This led to the 1970 energy crisis, and years of recession and hyperinflation.


Doesn't acknowledge humanity through lack of true communication

Excuse -- gives money, yet still doesn't recognize humanity.

> Invisible Side

= Not recognized by the society or by the speaker  


> Dying, flaccid toy balloons

= Dying promise. Figurative: Iridescence reflects idea?

## $$Thesis/Brainstorming:$$
```
```


~~The "black man" is not recognized by the speaker or the society as human, only~~

~~The speakers offhanded treatment of the "black man" represents the colonialists relationship to the colonized~~

###### The speakers off-handed treatment of the "black man" represents the dismissal of the colonized persons humanity. 

> Black, invisible side

Not recognized by the society or the speaker

> He speaks in perfect gibberish

Speaks, but his words are viewed as holding no meaning. 

Giving the money isn't actually helpful but a *symbol* of helpfulness. It's habit. The speaker is not engaging in true interaction, not acknowledging the humanity of the "black man."

> Say 'Good Night' from force of habit. Oh, mean habit! Not one word more apt or bright? 
"Good Night" is completely incorrect. Said out of habit, again, not acknowledging the humanity of the black man.

#### Theme: false promises

Reflected in flaccid balloons, government to people, and colonialists to colonized 

#todo : ask Alexa how this relates and whether or not to incorporate it.
