In amino acids, RNA and DNA,

Hard to get. 

#### Used in:
- Heme
- Nucleic Acid
- [[KBerefChlorophyll]]
- Amino Acids

## $$Nitrogen\ Fixing$$
Cannot use $N_2$ *(nonreactive nitrogen)* in the air. We need to somehow "fix" it. 

### Where it comes from
![[20bio201srcWorldNitrogenSource.png]]

#### Half from Bacteria | Biological
- [[KBe20bio101refBactera]]
- Diazotrophs (bacteria which have Nitrogenase)
	- Symbiotic bacteria in the soil with legumes
		- That's why legumes have more protein, because they have more available nitrogen.
		- Nitrogenase! 
	- Urine -> urea -> lots of ammonia -> good for plants / cows


#### Half from industrial nitrogen fixation | Industrial 
- Haber-Bosch process 
	- Invented by the same guy who invented poison gas / chemical weapons 
	- Without it, we wouldn't be able to feed around a third of the current population.
