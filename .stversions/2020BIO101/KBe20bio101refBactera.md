## Nitrogen
Plants have bacteria that turn $N_2$ into $NH_3$. The bacteria has a enzyme called nitrogenase.

So much fossil fuels are used in the fertilizer industry to do the same conversion. Why can't we just use the enzyme to make a bioreactor? The enzymes don't actually work with oxygen around.
