# Face verification
* That if Theodorus claims that Theaetetus' face and Socrates' face looks alike, Theaetetus ought to verify it agaist Theodorus' skill
* Otherwise, one should not trust him with something he is unskilled of

# What is knowledge?
* Knowledge is (not) wisdom?
* And also, it's difficult to define knowledge, anyways
* It's easy to define a point to an instance of knowledge, but difficult to get at what knowledge _is_ itself
* Simply perceiving something is also not knowledge
    * Perception varies person-to-person
    * Is not necessarily a "stable" metric
        * Different people have different views
        * Crazy people are not muses
    * Knowledge, in one case, could be contestable
    * Classification of things are often done as comparison
    * Knowledge is correction judgemen
    
> Then knowledge is to be found not in the experiences but in the process of reasoning about them; it is here, seemingly, not in the experiences, that it is possible to grasp being and truth.

* Soâ€¦ True judgments with evidence to support it => knowledge
