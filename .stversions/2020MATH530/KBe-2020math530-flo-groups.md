# Groups
- definition
	- closed
		- if $a, b \in S$ then $a + b \in S$
	- has an identity $e$
		- $e + a = a + e = a$
	- each element has an inverse
		- $-a + a = a + -a = e$
	- needs to be associative
		- $(a + b) + c$ = $a + (b + c)$
- communitivity is nice but not required
	- $a + b$ = $b + a$
- Which number systems are groups under addition and multiplication?

| Number System   | Multiplication | Addition    |
|-----------------|:--------------:|:-----------:|
| Natural Numbers | No inverse     | No identity |
| Whole Numbers   | No inverse     | No inverse  |
| Integers        | No inverse     | Yes         |
| Rationals       | Yes            | Yes         |
| Reals           | Yes            | Yes         |
