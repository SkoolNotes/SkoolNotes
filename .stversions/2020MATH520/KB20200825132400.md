- Discussion Results: what is a number?
	- Something about group theory
		- This is more like a way of telling us how to use numbers, not really a good definition.
		- Set up bounds to define things
	- Different classes (natural, real, imaginary)
	- Where do you draw the boundaries between objects?
	- A way to quantify the nature of living and reality
- Number Systems
	- We want them to be desirable and group-like
	- Types
		- **Natural Numbers**
			- Integers greater than zero
		- Whole Numbers
			- Natural Numbers + 0
			- 0 is the hole.
		- Integers
			- { ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ... }
			- Good for algebra, we'll see later
		- Rationals
			- Like $\frac{1}{2}$.
			- A ratio/fraction/quotient of integers
		- **Real**
			- Like $\pi$
			- A number on the number line
				- A number that can be a distance to something.
				- A good enough definition that isn't "real analysis"
		- **Complex Numbers**
			- Like $5i$
			- There will be many complex numbers
				- Matrices with complex numbers can be different from real numbers
			- Complex plane
		- Hamaltonian numbers music video? #curiosity
	- Why do we want more numbers?
		- Why Zero?
			- Additive identity
				- Zero vector = identity vector
				- Frame of reference, starting point, nice and neutral
		- Zintegers?
			- Why negatives?
				- So you can make zero
				- Undo each other, undo a $+5$
				- Inverse
					- $-a$ and $a$ are additive _inverses_
	- That's all we need to get to a group: [[KB20200825134500]]
