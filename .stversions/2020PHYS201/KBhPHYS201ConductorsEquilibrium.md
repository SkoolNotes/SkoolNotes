# Conductors at Equilibrium

If the charges on a conductor are **stationary**, no electron flow within the conductor… This means that

1) E-field _in_ the conducting material must be zero
   * Because, uhh...., the conductor is stationary, meaning no electron flow
   * So, without electric flow, you know that there is no electrons flowing, which means no electric field
   
## Charged Conductors at Equilibrium
2) Any electrons would cluster at the surface of the conductor
   * At equilibrium, the electrons would want to be as far away from each other as possible, meaning that they would stick to the surface — the part of the conductor w/ biggest perimeter/circumference
4) At the surface of the conductor, if any E-field is present, it must be perpendicular to the surface
    * If you have a horizontal component, the conductor would be, well, _conducting_ electricity, making it rather not static
    * If the E-Field is perpendicular, because we are in the Physics Vacuum, no charges will flow because it can't flow out of the conductor into something else
    
 > The net electric field inside a neutral conductor must be 0 equilibrium (at which point it is stationary)
 
* At curves, a conductor at equlibirium would cluster to maintain perpendicularity

- Electrons tend to flow into corners
	- Because there are more electrons towards the center and across the conductor to push all electrons towards the extremities
