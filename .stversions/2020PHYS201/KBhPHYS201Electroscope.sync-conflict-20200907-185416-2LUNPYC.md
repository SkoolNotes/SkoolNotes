About how this works…

1. Bring in some external charge near the electromitor (the ball-y part)
2. The rod becomes polarized, pushing the $+$ protons down towards the "gold leaves"
    * If the rod is not close enough to cause electron flow but is close enough to polarize…
        * Gold leaves temporarily push apart because positive repels positives
        * When charged rod removed, leaves come back
    * If the rod is close enough to cause $e^-$ to flow out of the electromitor, making the whole rod more positive instead of a temporary polarization…
        * Gold leaves permanently (until somebody/the air discharges it, anyways) separated
        * When charged rod removed, leaves stay put
