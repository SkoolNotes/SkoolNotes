**Notice! This one is a little different because there are three charges.**

We could see that, because of the fact that $Q_2$ is closer to $Q3$ then $Q1$ is and the two particles are pulling in different directions, we could infer that $||F_{32}||$ is larger then $||F_{31}||$. Because of this, we could find that $Q_3$ will have a net force "to the left" — in $F_{32}$'s direction. 

And, because of that, we know that $Q_3$ will be accelerating towards the left. But **Notice**!, whenever $Q_3$ moves towards the left, the distances between the particles changed, meaning the force acting upon $Q_3$ changes! Meaning, $Q_3$'s acceleration "to the left" is not constant. Unfortunately, then, no equation of kinematics for us :(.
