## One:

- I would expect to see numbers similar to the y intercept and slope of the line that the model is trying to fit (𝑦=0.3𝑥+1). In this particular example, I would expect to see an intercept close to 1, and a coefficients close to 0.3. 

## Two:

- I expected it to print out the corresponding y values when plugged back into the original equation. 

## Three:

- I expected to see a line similar to the graph of 𝑦=0.3𝑥+1. 

## Four 

- I changed the equation of the line to ```data_one_x['y'] = 1 * data_one_x['x'] + 1``` and verified that the code still functioned. The output was ```Intercept: [1.]  Coefficients: [[1.]]``` meaning that it came to the correct answer, verifying that the code was working properly.
