Made of a `hoddgepoddge` of petty kingdoms 

(Ming) China was the most advanced civilization in pre-modern times. 
- Much larger population
- Very fertile and irrigated planes

- Hiericharial administration run by educated confucian elites

Chinese invented the magnetic compass! (go us!)
Also, very early invention of printing. 
Had paper money, which expedited commerce 
And Gunpowder
Never plundered or murderd when travelling overseas to foreing lands
