## Watson *~*
`The Evolution of International Society; a comparative, Historical Analysis`


Classification words of civilizations are not descriptive enough. Way to broad. 


Empires fall along a spectrum from  absolute independence to absolute empire. The absolutes are theoretical and do not occur in practice. 


##### Four Broad Categories:
- Independence
- Hegemony
- Dominion
- Empire



Order -> peace / prosperity,  less freedom

Rules *expected to* benefit all members of system

> commitments to a collective security

**Freedom of action in an independent states is limited by the pressures of interdependence in a system**

`Hegemony = Being able to exert a *law* above the operatings of the system`

^ Sometimes though of as only one person 

Broader: 
`Hegemony =  Being albe to determine the relations between the members of an international society`

`Suzerainty = One state hold total political power over another`

> shadowy overlord-ship 

hegemony requires tacit acceptance 

`Dominion = Imperial authoirty determines the internal government of other communities, but retain their identity as seperate states and some control over their own affairs`


`Empire = direct administration of differnt communities from an imperial centre`
