**How spanish conquest in the americas caused an influx of wealth and the little ice age, which dragged everyone down and allowed western countries to take over as predoinant world powers.**

Lots of silver went to spain, caused wars and spread around. This, along with cold, caused famines and infighting everywhere.
Eventually the western states took power?

Basically, massive redistribution of wealth and power shifts in the 17-19th century.

Claims:

- Spanish conquest caused the little ice age
- conquest caused the turn of power from eastern to western countries
- flow of money tells who has power
- Mexico city has modern problems
    
Questions:

- How did the western countries take power?
