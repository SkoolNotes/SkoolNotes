# Ming's Governmental Decline

## Decline
* China never had a free market?? #why
    * Banned overseas trade 
* Order in 1433 from new emperor apparently banned these missions

## Reasons for Decline
* Seafaring was costly, and did not help the Northern Mongol invasions (duh)
* Japanese pirates did show up, but so did the Portuguese, but apparently they didn't care, so why?
* Government being worked against by the people => Rebels occurring at every level 
* The answerâ€¦ CONFUCIANISM! #sic
    * China is a conservative, Confucian country
        * Merchants are disliked
        * So are private capital
        * Armies are too!
        * A side note about tech
            * Confucianism actually does encourage tech
            * Simply requires building for knowledge or state purposes, and not for armies/private property
    * China attempted to emulate their "old ways", especially after the mongol clearing => caused closing
