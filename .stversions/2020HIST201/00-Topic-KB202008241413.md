> What are the top six most powerful countries in the world? 
> *Arta*

`define power as: influence over other countries ` - important, according to arta
^ *in relation to other countries* 

military power not as important anymore

1. China -> Huge amount of people, resources, millitary. Govermental system allows for easy control and progress. Ie. building a hospital in three days. + trade leverage 
2. North Korea. -> Power by insanity. Nixon (I think) once made the argument that other countries will be more wary / respect the wishes of countries with people in office that are *crazy*, because they will do anything. Kimmy is that crazy man. 
3. USA -> Lots of resources, I don't really know how we compare as I am infested with propaganda. 
4. India. Massive amount of people, growing insanely quickly. Will be much more powerful very soon. 
5. Russia -> Idrk, look at the election? Powerful meddling 

***nukes make things weird***

Machiavelli's ideas:
- How do his ideas of strength compare to yours?
- How relevant are his ideas today? 
	- if not, how has the world changed to make them so?
	- if so, how has the world stayed the same to make them so? 



> If Mercenary captains are capable men, then you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own greatness. But if the captain is not skilful, you are ruined in the usual way.
Less true with more beurocacy in modern day
