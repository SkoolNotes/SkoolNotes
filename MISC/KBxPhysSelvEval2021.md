# Share some thoughts about what you learned about your own learning in physics this rapid term.



Of course, I still feel the same way about solving symbolically that I did at the end of last semester. One more term, and some more thought later, I've realized that physics taught me how to use conceptual and higher level understanding to inform my math. This is a skill I've needed to use more in my recent Calculus classes, where relying on the math alone is often not enough to solve the more complicated problems. Physics class practices forming the link between the math — or more broadly, the problem solving technique — and the actual problem or scenario. I've noticed the practice I've gotten in physics come in handy in all sorts of places, most notably my USACO prep, and strangely enough, close reading.
