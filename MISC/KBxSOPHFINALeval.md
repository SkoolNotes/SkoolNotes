## ISOS
1) Think back on the three different projects you did this term: your history of science presentation, story of science, and ethical issues roundtable. Which are you proudest of, and why?
	1) I am most proud of our history of science presentation. We decided to do something different, something completely out of all of our comfort zones, and we pulled it off.  I learned a lot, got an entirely new experience, and people in class loved it.

2) Is there a habit of learning/habit of mind/student skill that this term in ISOS made you want to improve in yourself (e.g. procrastination, using work periods, participating in discussion, focusing on class, note-taking, chunking out projects)? (Be kind to yourself! It’s been a hard year, and learning/growing as a scholar is a life-long process.) 
	1) Organizing outside of class meeting time and group work is especially hard in the purely digital world. This is a skill that is new to me, but I expect to have to use a lot more in our increasingly technological reality. Thus, I would like to improve it.

3) How might you apply what you learned in ISOS this year (considering both fall and spring) to being a scientist in your science classes or to using scientific information to make informed choices as a citizen?
	1) Learning about the extent of p-hacking was quite startling for me. I will definitely take it into account when ingesting scientific information in the future.

## Japanese


Please reflect on your learning this past semester in the following areas.  Write a few sentences for each question (#1-3).  You don’t have to answer all the sub-questions; they are just suggestions.  Please answer in English.

1) Highlights

What were some of the highlights for you in Japanese this semester?  What work are you most proud of?  What have you learned this semester?  How have you grown this semester, either academically or personally?

2) Challenges

What area(s) challenged you the most this semester?  How did you deal with these challenges?  What can you do to improve in these areas?  What can I do to help you improve?

3) Goals

What were your goals for this semester?  What are your goals for next semester?  What topics or skills do you want to study next semester?  What are your long-term goals in Japanese?  How can I help you reach those goals?

Do you have any other questions, comments, or requests for me?

皆さん、今学期（こんがっき）は大変（たいへん）お疲れ様（つかれさま）でした。待ちに待った夏休みを楽しんでください。また来年、それともまたね。

Thank you for your heroic work this semester!  Enjoy your well-deserved summer vacation.  See you next year or—for those of you who are graduating—hope to see you again soon.
