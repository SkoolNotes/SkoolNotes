* The Role of the Lexical Analyzer

** Lexical vs Syntactic analysis
   1. Syntax and raw text are different and can be treated separately
   2. it may be more efficient
   3. better portability

** terms: tokens, patterns, lexemes
   - #definition token: is a name and a value, like a keyword or an identifier
   - #definition pattern: basically a regex of what string structures are allowed
   - #definition lexeme: part of the source text that is matched by a pattern as an instance of a token
