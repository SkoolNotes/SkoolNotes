1) What did you discover about yourself as a learner in this class, especially since we transitioned to remote learning, and what do you feel was your greatest success?

2) What has been your greatest challenge in our class this term? This could be a specific text, assignment, or activity, a broader area or skill, or could be related to remote learning specifically.

3) Now that you're on the other end of our year-long English 10 course, what do you see as the value of studying colonial/postcolonial literature and the literature associated with globalization, environmentalism, and science communication?

4) What are your goals for English for next year and beyond? What is next? Please be specific in highlighting at least two goals and giving some sense of how you might meet them.
