	Suppose $T \in \mathcal L(V, W)$ and $U$ is a subspace of $V$. Let \pi denote the quotient map from $V$ onto $V/U$. Prove that there exists $S \in \mathcal L(V/U, W)$ such that $T = S \circ \pi$ if and only if $U \subseteq \text{null }T$.

  Intuitively, if we mod out part of the $\text{null }T$, then we should still be able to have a map that does what $T$ would do, and if we are able to do what $T$ would do, then we only removed part of $\text{null }T$ and lost no information.

  Intuitively, if we lost information, then we can't reconstruct what $T$ would do.

  If $U \nsubseteq \text{null }T$, then there exists $v \in U$ s.t. $Tv \neq 0$. This is some of the "information" that was "lost". Because $v \in U$,
  \( \pi v = U + v = U \)
