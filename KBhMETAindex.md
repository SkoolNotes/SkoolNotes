I guess now that @Exr0n started a trend I will also create a naming convention that should be almost compatible with R0n's.

# General Naming

General note file names will be named roughly ``KBhCOURSE##UpperCamelCaseName[Tag]``

|  Item     |                                    Note                                                       |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Course##` | This is the course number. It should be all caps, with 3-4 letter course + level. Like `MATH401`|
| `[Tag]`   | Optional information about the note                                                           |

## Tags

| Tag    |             Meaning           |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| index | Master Index                  |
| read  | Reading Note                  |
| ln    | Large Note (the old 00-index) | 


Yeah. That's it.
